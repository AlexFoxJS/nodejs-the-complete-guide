1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,470
Amazing job you made it for the entire course and that means you learn a lot about node and the many

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:14,290
ways you can use it to build exciting web applications or any kind of application that needs to execute

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,350
some code really.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,700
I hope you enjoyed the course and the obvious question is how should you now continue.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:27,020
Well in general the most important thing I always recommend is that you keep on practicing.

6
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,070
Build example projects.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,940
Clone popular apps build your own simplified Facebook clone.

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:40,660
Strip out some features you don't want to focus on and instead build some parts off that application

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,590
you picked.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,630
Build the messaging part build the news feed part.

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,160
Anything like that.

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,760
Practicing is important and the most important thing there is that you will face issues.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,360
You'll hit some problems.

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,720
There will be things what you want to build where you don't know how to continue where you don't know

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,690
how it works.

16
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:06,190
And then the part where you need to dig in where you need to research search on Stack Overflow find

17
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,740
block posts on Google that help you and dig through that problem on your own.

18
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:18,040
This will make you a better developer and it will help you learn how things work internally and how

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,960
you can approach certain problems and solve them.

20
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,460
This is the most important part really.

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:31,160
Now also dive into our concepts related to notorious dive into API eyes like rest API or graphics.

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:39,760
Learn more about these technologies build exampled project Stehr to dive into certain less technologies

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,830
and to serve less services.

24
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:47,380
I got a course on that but you can also just google for node J.S. serval S and you'll find some great

25
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,380
resource there because that is also a very promising interesting way of creating node applications as

26
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,140
you will learn.

27
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,770
You focus way more on your logic and way less on the overhead of spinning up a surveillance on.

28
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:06,370
So really interesting and maybe you to dive into Front-End development learn how to build a re-act up

29
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:12,100
like the one I gave you in this course from scratch that could be a great next step too because it will

30
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,970
make you a full stack developer who can do both.

31
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:20,710
Back in development and frontages development and these are just some of the possibilities you have

32
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:26,860
obviously as you practice you'll dive into more things that are interesting to you and to your exact

33
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,470
requirements and things that are interesting to you.

34
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,310
And I'm confident that this course gave you pretty solid fundamentals that allow you to build up on

35
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,180
and to dive way deeper.
