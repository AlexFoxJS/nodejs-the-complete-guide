1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:08,870
So let's make sure we can also fetch a single post and for that I'll go to my schema again because on

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,310
the schema is where I will work.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:20,790
And so here I will add a new query host which will get an input and Id off that single post I want to

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,580
fetch.

5
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,880
And will return a post in the end.

6
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,750
This is how my query should look like in the schema definition.

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,590
Now let's of course also add a resolver for this single post for Dad.

8
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,910
I'll go to my resolvers J.S. fall.

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,330
Add it down there.

10
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:43,060
Use the async function syntax like this.

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,310
And in that function here.

12
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:52,990
Just as in the function up there I'll get arguments and the request object with object destructuring.

13
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,000
I can get my post ID or whatever you chose as a name here.

14
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,660
So in my case just ID out of that request.

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:09,230
Arguments object I get the request object as well and first of all I can check whether a user is authenticated.

16
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:17,750
So I will copy this check and at this year and then as a next step I will add the logic to retrieve

17
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,610
a single post and vedette.

18
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:29,990
I'll get my post by awaiting post fine by ID for the ID I get as an argument.

19
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:37,160
Now I will also populate the creator here so that we have all the user data and not just the ID and

20
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:47,200
there after all check if we did not find a post in which case all create a new RR No post found and

21
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,790
also set a code of 404 and Frode error.

22
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:59,390
But if we make it after or past this check we know we have a post and then I'll return an object where

23
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:07,290
I get all the data from that post and then again I overwrite the ID because I can't return object IDs

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:16,420
so post underscore ID to string and the same for created ad because I can't return dates created at

25
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:25,850
two ISO's string and update it at will also be changed to Isel string.

26
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,280
With that in place I have everything I need to fetch a single post.

27
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:35,600
I'd say let's now go back to the front end and wired it up and there.

28
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,500
I'm interested in a single post in.

29
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,490
Well single post page here in there in component at Mt..

30
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,640
I'm sending my request and I'll again adjust.

31
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:56,610
You are l to go to local host ADHD slash graph Q L them Meffert here will be a post request for the

32
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,320
headers.

33
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:08,340
I add my content type application Jason header and I will need to prepare my graph you all query here

34
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:17,530
which is as before an object with a query key and then a query is surrounded by these tactics and in

35
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,020
there.

36
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,130
Well I want to reach out to my post query.

37
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:29,850
I will send my ID so my post ID I get up there should be surrounded with quotation marks.

38
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,800
And regarding the fields that I'm interested in.

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:41,250
Well they're after I use the creator name the title the image you are l the date the created at Date.

40
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,240
To be precise and the content.

41
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:52,600
So I want to fetch that one to fetch the title content image to your L creator and for the Creator only

42
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,540
the name.

43
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,510
And then also create to that that is what I'm interested in.

44
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,570
And this is now what I will append as a body to my request.

45
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:10,740
So Jason's string ify and at discraft Ul-Qadri here with that we are sending that request as you learn

46
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,230
before handling the error.

47
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,110
There will not really work.

48
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,890
We want to handle that error ofter we parsed the response data and then we can check for errors.

49
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,930
So I'll copy that logic from feet J.S. into a single post.

50
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,900
Genius here where I check if we have any EHRSSON that fro an error if we have no arrows.

51
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:36,640
We just need to drill into the response and for that you must not forget how your schema looks like

52
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,490
we'll have data then we have that name of the Kuri which is post and then we can access our different

53
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,460
post properties.

54
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:54,760
So here we access rest state DOT data and then indeed dot post dot Tidelands on.

55
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:01,470
So just dot data has to be added to all these places where I extract some data.

56
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,990
And with that I should be able to load a single post saved ad and make sure your back end is saved.

57
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,590
And click on View and looks like I have an error.

58
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,170
My you are.

59
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,040
Yes this colon needs to go.

60
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:23,740
Now let's click view I get user log in and failed.

61
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,810
That is the wrong error message I copied there.

62
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,970
Fetching post failed but somehow it failed.

63
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,140
Let's quickly check what's wrong.

64
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,450
Yes there is a syntax error in the query.

65
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:44,580
We need to have surrounding curly braces around the overall query so added your to have opening and

66
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,010
closing curly brace right at the start and end and there ofter.

67
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:54,650
If you click on a single post now you'll load the post data there.

68
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,200
So this is now working.

69
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,150
What's missing is a possibility to edit and delete posts.

70
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,980
And of course to work with the user status.

71
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,730
So let's work on that next.
