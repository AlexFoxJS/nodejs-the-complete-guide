1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,290
On the front end in the finish add a handler function in the feet.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,670
JS file there.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,970
I'll ignore the image upload for now.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,720
I want to now reach Mike Rathcoole and point and create a new user for debt.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,910
First of all I will get rid of this code because I will not send this request to defend you or else

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,420
any more and I'll not use different methods.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:33,690
It's always the same your L and the same method localhost ADHD graphed U L and the method simply is

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,450
host.

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,940
The body is all an open forum data.

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,460
But here I'll create a new query with LET because this will change when we edit the post later and my

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,700
query here is crap.

12
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:56,310
Well query my query here is defined as before query and then dessous multi-line string with back takes

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,280
it then actually is a mutation and the mutation is create post to that.

14
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,200
I need to send the data I did on my graphical user interface.

15
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:16,320
So actually I can copy that Yeater move that over there and now replace these hardcoded values with

16
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,740
dynamic values.

17
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:26,870
So here for the title I will pass post data title for the content.

18
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,920
I will pass post data content in the image.

19
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,240
I'll keep that to some your L for now.

20
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,640
Until we have a real image.

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,650
I get back to the idea and title.

22
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:48,460
Now let me first of all send this in a string if I were in the graph will query and then lets do something

23
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,700
with the response.

24
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,390
Now again this way of handling it will not really work.

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,250
So let's instead copy the code where we use an app geus where I check for errors on the extract of the

26
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,990
response body.

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,330
They offer I'd do it here.

28
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:11,380
Then I log my response data and you see I'm interested in the ID title content creator and created that

29
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,850
here.

30
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,140
So I should actually retrieve all of that.

31
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,390
So in my query I get the ID title content image.

32
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:28,720
You are l creator and created at St..

33
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:37,430
By the way the creator if you have a look at my schema is again a more complex object.

34
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,930
It's a user object.

35
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,350
So for the Creator we need to be more specific and that is the cool thing about graph.

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,860
All we can really drill into the data here.

37
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,780
Let's say I'm only interested in the name and indeed I am.

38
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,860
I don't care about the ID or email.

39
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:57,040
In this scenario here I want a name so that I can rendered it onto the screen next to my posts and this

40
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,190
shows the power of graph to really well we get exactly the data we need well.

41
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:08,950
Now with that we sent the post request here for extracting that data will have some problems.

42
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,060
But first of all let's focus on what we locked to the console and see if that works.

43
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:23,120
So back to our application I am still locked in because I have a valid token and I do still attached

44
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,440
as token by the way here.

45
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,690
But we all need a number header.

46
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:33,530
We need to add the content type and set that to application chase and that is required.

47
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,670
So make sure you add this.

48
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:41,110
And now back in the application click new post add a deck.

49
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,280
You have to choose the image here even though it's not uploaded.

50
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,600
Otherwise you can submit and then I'll add my lovely duck.

51
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,690
And here I get an error which was expected.

52
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,760
But I also see a console log which actually doesn't look too bad.

53
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:03,260
I do have all the data I entered and we can now have a look at more.

54
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:11,420
Would he be Compaq's and there if I refresh this and look into my post collection I indeed see a post

55
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,300
with the data I entered with that creator.

56
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,110
Ending with a 1.

57
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,780
If I have a look at my users I see that it's that user and they are on the posts.

58
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:28,850
I am unfortunately missing my post so that is one thing I will need to tweak but the rest is already

59
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,170
working really well.

60
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,650
Let's make sure we at that post here too.

61
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,390
And then of course let's make sure we extract the data on the front and correctly so that we also rendered

62
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,920
that post for Dad.

63
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,990
By the way we'll all have to make sure we load all posts initially though.
