1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:07,550
We added validation and we see that a failing validation and hence of an error.

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:15,640
As we were doing it here leads to a response that actually has null in the data it gives us back but

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:21,630
that has an error or a key with an array of all the arrows Gabbert.

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,730
If you open the network tap right away.

5
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,240
And you relax.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,130
Q Did you also see that it sets a status code of 500.

7
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:31,900
No that's nice.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,370
But sometimes you want to add more detailed information.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,700
You can set your own status code though.

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,600
But we could add more information to the arrows.

11
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:47,990
We'd return and to do that you can go to your Actually us file and there where you configure your draft

12
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,200
Cuil API.

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,580
You can add a number a configuration option which is called format error and this is actually a method

14
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:04,020
which receives the error detected biographical and allows you to return your own format.

15
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,520
Now if you just return error you keep the default format which is exactly the format we see here.

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,430
But you can change it of course.

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:19,740
You can check if in your error here you don't have the original Arrowfield.

18
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,150
So if you don't have that hence the exclamation mark at the beginning or original error will be set

19
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:31,570
by express graph Cuil when it detects an error free zone in your code either by you or some third party

20
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,440
package.

21
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,690
If you have a technical error let's say a missing character in your query here or anything like that

22
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,860
then it will not have that original error.

23
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:48,280
And if we don't have that then I'll just return the error that was generated by graph Q L but if I do

24
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:56,290
have my original error Well then I can extract useful information from it that I can add in other places

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:04,240
and that is what we can do into resolder Now let's say validation fails on the error that gets created

26
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,030
here.

27
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:11,830
I could add a data field which is my array of errors which I populate here with my validation error

28
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,730
messages.

29
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:20,510
I could also add a code here which is set to 422 or I come up with my own coding system.

30
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:28,690
I don't have to use HTP status codes here and now in actually yes I can retrieve all of that from the

31
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,760
original error so I can get my data from error.

32
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,420
Original error data.

33
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,120
And that might be undefined for grown aerostat though and said it but that's ok.

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,050
I can retrieve my message directly from the error because Dad has already pulled out of the error.

35
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:57,290
Biographical And in case that should be undefined somehow I can set this to an error or cur'd and I

36
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:04,660
can get my code from the original error again Dare I named that code too.

37
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,240
And it could set this to a default value of 500.

38
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:16,360
Now if all that pulled out I can return my own error object here where I have a message just like the

39
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,510
original one but where I'd then also add my status field which contains my code and a data field which

40
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,560
contains my data.

41
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,390
And you can name all these fields in exactly the way you want.

42
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,240
And now with that and all the files saved here.

43
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,880
If I hit enter again or play again.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,310
Now I see I get a different era output with the data I added and this can be very useful.

45
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,400
And this is how you can handle errors engraft you El.
