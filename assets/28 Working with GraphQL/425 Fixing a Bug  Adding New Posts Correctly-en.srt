1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:10,140
Know let's first of all thicks the fact that our user does not have the post added to his posts Saray

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,050
the reason for that is that I do push to post here.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,540
But of course I forgot one important thing.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:23,430
I never saved debt change I need to call users savior and I'm not interested in the result but I certainly

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,790
want to await it none the less so that I only return after this has been done.

6
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,520
So this is one important change and this is only one change we need though we can quickly validate whether

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,320
it works.

8
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:43,270
However by going to posts let's delete that post which we added here and now let's go back to our front

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,330
and add and you post and number.

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,140
Duck choose an image even though it's not getting used.

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,560
Let's add some content and click except we still get that error.

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,360
But if we go back to camp pass we have a look at our users for the first user.

13
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,140
We now also see that post here.

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,790
So Dad is now working.

15
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,850
And now let's make sure we also extract the data correctly on the Front-End and that we don't all load

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,060
all posts so that we really can see them there.

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,000
Now for the data extraction we see that this is the data in the format we get it back.

18
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,640
An object with a data field then the name of our query and then in another nested object the fields

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,730
for that query.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,000
And this is exactly how we have to retrieve our data.

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,720
So in our re-act code in feet.

22
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,160
J.S. here.

23
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,630
When I create my post there and I try to access the response data post and this will not work.

24
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,750
I have two axes rest data data.

25
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,860
Create post so here its rest data data.

26
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:57,470
Create post ID and debt is the case for all these places.

27
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:05,100
Whoops where I do access fields on my created post.

28
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,900
Now with that we should not get an error message anymore.

29
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,320
When I create a new post at least.

30
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,910
So let's try it out.

31
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,230
Let's choose to cap image though it does not matter.

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,470
We're not uploading it it accept and I don't get that error anymore.

33
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,450
So extracting the data works.

34
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:31,870
Now let's focus on adding a query that allows us to get our posts so that we can also rendered him here.

35
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,980
This is also a great practice for you will do together in the next lecture.

36
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,080
Try fetching your posts on your own.

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,300
Try creating that query on the back and on your own.

38
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,330
You don't need to tweak the front end code.

39
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,290
If you can do that.

40
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:51,150
Perfect will do it together Oberweis but add your graphical query and test it with the graphical interface.
