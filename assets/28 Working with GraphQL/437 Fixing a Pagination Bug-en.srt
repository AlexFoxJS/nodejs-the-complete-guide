1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:09,190
Now there's one thing you also might have noticed when we only have two posts so we have no page nation

2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:14,930
because we don't have enough poets to have a second page and add a new value like a duck here.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,500
Then the stock will show up but we don't get that next button.

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,430
There is a little box here which is easy to fix has nothing to with no chance.

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,850
But it is really easy to get rid of in or finish edit handler here.

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:39,390
When we go down to decode where we create that new post and we then add to our existing posts it's this

7
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:46,380
block here which is interesting to us where we in the end make sure that we only render two items at

8
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,070
a time and then we add our new post at the beginning of the list.

9
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:59,610
Now here what I need to do is I need to make sure that I do increase the amount of total posts in our

10
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,140
state in re-act here where we manage how many posts we have on that page.

11
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,180
I do set total posts here to a different amount of posts.

12
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:16,260
When I fetch all posts where I get that total posts information well when adding a new element I know

13
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,110
that total posts will simply be the old total posts plus one.

14
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,420
So I will add a new variable here.

15
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,340
Right below up the posts and that's updated.

16
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:33,900
Total Posts and that will be previous state total posts and that is a bit off re-act logic here but

17
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:40,130
this first of all takes the old status and now when I do go into to the else block which is the case

18
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:48,960
when I am not editing but what I am adding then I want to set updated total posts plus 1 with the plus

19
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,290
plus syntax I incremented by 1 and then here is the return statement.

20
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,270
I'll set the total posts equal to updated total posts and have this change in place.

21
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:07,080
Fine I'll quickly delete my doc again so that I'm back to two items and I do add my doc so that I go

22
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,570
up to free items again.

23
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,580
Now you see that next button and you can use it of course because now we're managing the total post

24
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,380
correctly too.

25
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,220
So that's just a Leelah adjustment has nothing to do with Knode or graphs you all.

26
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,850
But since I spotted that bug I of course also want to get rid of it.

27
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:30,210
And with that we moved our entire rest API over to graft to L and I hope you see the power graph tool

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:37,530
gives you by being more flexible regarding the data you fetch from the backend and therefore your front

29
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:44,640
that development can move faster because your back and gives you the entire bandwidth of data.

30
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,050
You might be interested in.
