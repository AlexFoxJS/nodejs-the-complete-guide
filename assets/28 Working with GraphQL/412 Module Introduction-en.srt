Welcome to this module the best things always come at the end.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:11,100
In this module I want to dive into an exciting piece of technology whether you will dive into graph

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:17,420
Cuil and alternative to building a restful API that you would use in the same scenarios.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:25,010
So when you have a de-coupled front and back end you will not render use with a graph to Al API to but

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,350
it provides some significant advantages over rest.

6
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,510
API eyes at least in certain scenarios.

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:38,790
So in this module we'll explore what graphical actually is and how it compares to rest API eyes and

8
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:45,770
you will learn how to use graphs you of course will actually take our existing project and turn it into

9
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,830
a graph l API or use a graphical API.

10
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,640
A very exciting technology.

11
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,670
I'm super excited to get started with it.

12
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,680
So let's dive in.
