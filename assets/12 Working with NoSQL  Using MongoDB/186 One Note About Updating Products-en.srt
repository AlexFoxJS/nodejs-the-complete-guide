1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:09,240
Now one important note about Update video what I did there is I actually passed an object id in admen

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,340
chase controller to my product constructor.

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:19,720
Now actually I could also just pass product that has a string and therefore remove my object registration

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,140
up there and the Hmong would he be import all of that is happening in the controller.

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:29,610
Now if I do that and I try editing this and changed apprized to 16.

6
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,660
You see now it fails.

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:40,060
Now if we go to the product model and we have a look at the safe method to dare I am actually looking

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:47,500
forward to right write object but I'll have a problem with updating it because there I'll try to set

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:54,590
my object ID to a different object to a string because here I'm just referring to this which will hold

10
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,690
the unmodified object.

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:03,820
So what I should do is I should automatically convert the object id the ID here which is a string to

12
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,500
an object that the object in the constructor.

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,030
So now they can remove it down there because I underscore ID will now always be an object id field no

14
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,370
matter if I'm using it in a filter or if I'm using it for updating.

15
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:23,520
So now if that if I added this again and I changed the price to 18 now it works again.

16
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:30,240
Because now I'm not trying an invalid update by trying to change the ID to some invalid value.

17
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,800
So this is just an important note I wanted to add.

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,310
You don't have to count words the ID in the controller file.

19
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:42,010
You can leave that untouched but you can do a general conversion in the product choice model of file

20
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,610
which is the better approach of doing that.
