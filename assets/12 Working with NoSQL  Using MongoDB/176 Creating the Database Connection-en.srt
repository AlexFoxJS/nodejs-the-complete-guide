1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:10,080
Be connected to Mongo D.B and this is nice but it also means that we can't do anything else right now.

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,240
The rest of the app is not working anymore.

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,060
And of course it should work.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:21,370
So let's get there step by step and let's start by resetting the admin routes.

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,820
So let's ask this middleware again and for this I also need to import admen routes again.

6
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:34,480
And if we now have a look into our admen controller here we do of course use the product model and the

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,880
product model.

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,580
We have a look into that does rely on sequel lies of course because we define the product model with

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,140
the help of equalize.

10
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,670
Now that is all something which we won't do anymore.

11
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,170
Instead we now want to use Mongo DVH.

12
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:59,860
So to get there I will remove these two imports up there and instead And here I want to create a new

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,740
class again because I'll create my own model again.

14
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:08,980
And this is something we did before already in the pure My siecle module saw create a product class

15
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,770
here like this.

16
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:16,940
And of course I will also export this submodule exports will still be my class here.

17
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:25,690
Now in that class I'll have a constructor and in that constructor here I want to store the title price

18
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,170
image Eurail and description of the product when it gets created.

19
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:38,560
So here I will simply get the title the price description and image you are l and that in the constructor

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:47,440
I'll say this title equals title this prize equals prize this description equals description well and

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:47,830
so on.

22
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,830
You know the game.

23
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,820
So your image your L equals image your l.

24
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:59,290
Now we can create a new product in javascript and you will object which follows this forum.

25
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:04,350
And now to save it in the database I will also add a Save method here.

26
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:11,230
So a function which can be executed on this class and then here I now want to connect to Mongar D.B

27
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,810
and save my product.

28
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,870
Now to do that to be able to connect.

29
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,600
I'll need to import Mongo D-B or Mongar connect.

30
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:27,840
So import Mongo connect from my utility folder and then from the database file.

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,260
So I will simply import that method.

32
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,860
The function I created here where you pass a callback to where we do connect to more would he be inside.

33
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,830
And then we basically execute the call bag and return the connect to the client so that we can interact

34
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,850
with it.

35
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:51,620
However if we do this we would have to connect to Muang would be for every operation we do.

36
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,960
And we would not even disconnect or after.

37
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:00,150
So this is not really a good way of connecting to Hmong would he be since we will want to connect and

38
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,780
interact with it from different places now wrap.

39
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:09,600
So it would be better if we could manage one connection in our database and then simply return access

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,960
to the client which we set up once from there or to a different place in our app that need access and

41
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:23,040
to do that all Kune my set up here a bit let's unit together in the next lecture.
