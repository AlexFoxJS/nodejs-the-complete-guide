1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:09,410
So let's work on our shop pages now and let's make sure we can use our data there for this.

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,790
Let me go to my product model again and here the sides be able to save data.

3
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:21,300
Of course all they want to be able to get my products so I'll add a static method again and I'll name

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,050
that fetch all.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:32,370
Now here I want to interact with MY MOM WOULD IT BE database to fetch all products for this I will again

6
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:39,370
return and then use D-B collection to tell me where to be to which collection to connect to and are

7
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,000
a collection.

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,340
I want to connect to is products of course.

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,730
And then their moment to be has a method for finding data which is called Find.

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,350
Now find could be configured to also use a filter.

11
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,550
For example we could find all products that have a type of a book and there are more elaborate filters

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,440
than just the quality filters available too.

13
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,810
Again something I cover in great detail in MY MOM WOULD BE course if you want to learn more about that

14
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:07,850
here.

15
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,090
Of course want to find all products for now.

16
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,070
So want to find all products which you can do by just calling find like this note important thing about

17
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,620
find is find does not immediately return a promise though.

18
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,420
Instead it returns a so-called cursor.

19
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,310
A cursor is an object provided by Hmong would it be.

20
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:34,170
Which allows us to go through our elements our documents step by step because theoretically and a collection

21
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,960
find could of course return millions of documents and you don't want to transfer them over to wire all

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
at once.

23
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,790
So instead find gives you a handle which you can use to tell the only to be OK.

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,620
Give me the next document OK give me the next document and so on.

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,990
That being said there is a two array method you can execute to tell me long would it be to get all documents

26
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,080
and turn them into a javascript array.

27
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:06,120
But you should only use that if you know that we're talking about let's say a couple of dozens maybe

28
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,970
one hundred documents.

29
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,710
Otherwise it's better to implement page nation which is something we will implement at a later point

30
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,200
of time in this course.

31
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,390
So for now let's use two aere and then does returns a promise.

32
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:25,330
And here we can again catch any errors we might be getting.

33
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:34,130
But most importantly here we should have our products we can log our products here and then also let's

34
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,830
return our products in here and let's see if that works the way we want.

35
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,350
So now we have a fecche all method that hopefully works.

36
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:48,770
One important thing is I of course need to get access to my database by calling get D-B in fecche all

37
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,870
just as they do it and save.

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:57,210
And now let's head over to our shop controller and there we have the get products function.

39
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,340
Now this is the function I want to work on now.

40
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:07,610
And instead of find all let's now use fetchmail because that is how I named the method there I should

41
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:12,140
get my products and hopefully get them in a format that works.

42
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,330
Let's see.

43
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:20,770
Let me also go to my shop route's now and here get index and get products.

44
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,800
Be Fine.

45
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:28,130
Let me comment out all other routes for the moment because we can't work with them right now because

46
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,090
we have no code that would support them by the way in the shop controller you also want to make sure

47
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,620
that get index works but also using fetchmail in there.

48
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,950
So just as we did it and get products we want to do the same and get index.

49
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,620
OK.

50
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,750
So now I got some code in place.

51
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:54,800
Let me go back to J.S. finally and comment in that Schopper import and not just comment it in of course

52
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:01,340
but also uncomment this middleware down there and now we hopefully have a set up where we can actually

53
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,740
reload our route route.

54
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,110
Let's say these are just local host 3000.

55
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,520
And here we go.

56
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,060
Here is our product just like that.

57
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,290
And of course it works automatically because it didn't change any property names.

58
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,120
If you suddenly store to Thailand a field named name you would have to adjust your view and so on.

59
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:30,380
Well there is something where I want to adjust my view and deaths related to how we work with the IDs

60
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,480
but we'll see it in the next lecture.
