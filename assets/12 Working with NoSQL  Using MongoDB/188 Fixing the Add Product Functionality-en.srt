1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:11,100
The leading works but when I try to at product and I'll just enter some dummy data here that fails and

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:20,000
it seems to fail because I would imagine that in safe here we somehow make it into this if block so

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,430
that underscore ideas to a problem and that makes sense because I actually do initialize underscore

4
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,510
ID here at the beginning by creating a new Mongo D-B object.

5
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:35,480
So even if we pass no ID and this therefore is undefined this will create an object and store in an

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,460
underscore ID.

7
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,870
So underscore id down there will always be defined.

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,990
And if its just such an empty are automatically generated object id object should be the issue here.

9
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,710
So how can I overcome this.

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:56,660
Well for example for turn every expression we can check if ID exists basically.

11
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:03,110
So if this returns true and if statement and if its the case then I want to create my object id object.

12
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:08,060
Otherwise all store now and now will be treated as false down there.

13
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,520
So if this tiny change in place with this turn their expression added in a product model we should be

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,660
able to add a product real quick with some dummy values.

15
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,560
And now its created.

16
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,820
So now does this working.

17
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:26,310
And it was just the fact that we were always creating an object that you object which we shouldn't.
