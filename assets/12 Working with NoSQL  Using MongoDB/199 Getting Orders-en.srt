1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,460
So now did we added some relational information to our orders.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:13,420
We can go back to getting all the orders in our user Jay fall in the models folder there I half get

3
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:20,590
orders and now I want to reach out to my orders and simply find them all or at least find all four dead

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,430
user.

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,670
Now how do I find all orders for that user.

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,650
Well remember each order has a user object and in the User object we have the idea of that user.

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,170
So we need to compare dead ID to the current user ID.

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,830
Now to do this we add a filter and now would it be.

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,350
You can also check nested properties by defining the path to them.

10
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:47,500
The only important thing to know here is that you need to use quotation marks around the path and then

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,410
you can say check user.

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,220
And then the idea for the user.

13
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:58,810
You do that by specifying user dot underscore ID and this will look for underscore ID in the user property

14
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,230
which holds and then bad a document.

15
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:08,620
And then here I can compare it is to a new object id for this ID and this should give me all orders

16
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,900
for that user and this will now be more than one.

17
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:19,150
So again we can use to two aere shortcut and return that data to return an array of orders for that

18
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:26,670
user and our user here for example has two orders because we got two orders for that user ID.

19
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,960
So now we want to output that order information.

20
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,540
So let's go to the shop controller get orders now.

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,620
I named my function get orders here too.

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,520
So calling that here should work.

23
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,470
We don't need data anymore that include thing was relayed to sequel's.

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,950
I then get back my orders and I passed them to the orders view.

25
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,120
So let's now just inspect that orders view here and there.

26
00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:00,150
I loop through all my orders and for every order I have an underscore ID that's important.

27
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,090
And then in the orders I don't have products we could name it as such but I named the items here.

28
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,230
So I'll loop through all the items now.

29
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,690
There will be product information in there though.

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,280
For example the title and the quantity which is now a top level field and product.

31
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,310
So we access it like this.

32
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,600
And with that out of the way let's save that and let's go to the route's folder and there to shop as

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,190
fall and comment in that one orders route you removed earlier.

34
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,940
And let's now click on orders up there get to be is not the find.

35
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,300
That should be a typo in get orders and the user remodel.

36
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,750
Yeah this should be get D-B with a lower case b.

37
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,270
So let's read that page and does looks much better.

38
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:52,950
Now we got our orders with their ID and with the items we ordered.

39
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,410
So this is now working.

40
00:02:54,430 --> 00:03:00,970
Now we got that basic shop functionality working again which we had work earlier with sequel.

41
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:08,730
Now we're doing it with Mongo D-B now Aguas deep just as we used sequel eyes for a sequel.

42
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:16,300
To make certain things easier we can do the same with Mongo D-B And also we can find an alternative

43
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,460
that makes our life a bit easier.
