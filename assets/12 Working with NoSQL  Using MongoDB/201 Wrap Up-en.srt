1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:08,840
In this module we had to look at no sequel and especially long would it be of course now no sequel database's

2
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:14,840
Mulready B is just an alternative to sequel database's It follows a different philosophy.

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,210
You have no strict schema schemas what you do have and sequel and you have fewer relations.

4
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,310
You don't split your data across dozens of tables.

5
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:30,230
Instead you work with things like and batting data or using some reference or even mixing the two concepts

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,200
as you saw in this module too.

7
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,320
So in general you've got way more flexibility.

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,650
And since you can store the data in the format you are fetching it in.

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:47,710
You often can write a bit simpler coteries because data already has the format you needed in.

10
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,810
When working with mung would he be.

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,860
You should use the official Mangu to be driver and then you got a lot of useful commands like injured

12
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:02,210
one find update one delete one and so on which make all these crud operations corrupt stands for create

13
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,880
read update and delete.

14
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,110
Very simple.

15
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:12,290
Now check out the official docs or my full mobility course to learn all about the a way lable operations

16
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,500
how you can configure them which operators like dollar sign in which you sign this Marchal.

17
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:23,720
So all these things which you can use you can learn about that because indeed Mangu to be offers enough

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,530
content for an entire course.

19
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:31,640
And this is of course not the idea behind this course it should stay A.J. of course now it's also worth

20
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:38,240
pointing out that all the operations are promised based and they are for creating more complex chains

21
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,310
as we did it.

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,670
Where you have this first command and then the second command is pretty easy and is pretty easy to read.

23
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:52,310
So overall no sequel in Hmong would be very popular especially in combination with no chases because

24
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,770
you work with javascript objects anyways and because it's very fast and therefore it's definitely worth

25
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,620
checking out.

26
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,290
And I will also stick to more.

27
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,690
Would it be for the rest of this course though.

28
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,460
I also want to mention that you can of course use MS sequel.

29
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:12,780
Ultimately it always depends on your preferences and the requirements of your application and there

30
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,850
is a large gray area where neither of the two is wrong to use.
