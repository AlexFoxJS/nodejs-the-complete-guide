1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,520
Now that you had a brief introduction to what Mongo DB is and what no sequel databases are let's install

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:08,730
more.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,340
Would it be.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,160
Let's set it up and let's use it for our project here now to install longer to be.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,090
You can either do that locally on long would he be dot com you can click on get Mongo D-B download the

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,880
installer or the tools when you click on community server here and follow the insulations struction

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,400
and this will all work and it will give you a locally running along with the server.

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,140
Now I would go for a cloud solution here because it's a more realistic environment.

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,760
You would use for a deployment anyways and it's really easy to set up and it's free.

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,580
And that will be Atlas Atlas.

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,260
So I got here by clicking on get more would be and then choosing Atlus.

12
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,320
Now again this is free.

13
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,570
You don't need a credit card or anything like that.

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,120
You just need to sign up and you can spin up your own in the cloud.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,520
Best practice managed long would be server which is a great environment for practicing because this

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,750
will follow all the best practices so sign up here.

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,800
Now once you did sign up you should end up on a page that looks something like this.

18
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,510
Maybe you need to create in your project first give it any name you want and then you should be on that

19
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,850
page where you can build a new cluster.

20
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,540
You might also end up in dead which are derived from the start.

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,960
Now here you are among the cloud clusters so basically among the TBS server and they offer a longer

22
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,230
to be database or multiple data amazes as many as you want running into a server.

23
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,060
You can generally leave all the default settings.

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,970
Make sure to do you choose a region where a free tier is available behind the scenes moment it uses

25
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,150
one of these cloud providers but you don't need to be signed up with them or anything like that.

26
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,600
So you can choose anything you want here then you choose to cluster tier there you should use the free

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,210
one zero where it says free.

28
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:56,590
And then this will not cost you anything under additional settings you can will lethal defaults.

29
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,970
You can change to any ways in the frontier but that's fine.

30
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,010
You can change a class name if you want to then you can click Create cluster and this will now create

31
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:05,920
a new cluster.

32
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:12,660
We'll take a couple of minutes which you then can connect to later and what you Denn can use as your

33
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,530
Bakken.

34
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,620
Now one important note you might see that I have some cost here in this account and this is not coming

35
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,710
from the set up.

36
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,720
I'm showing you here.

37
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,700
I was simply using this for some of the set up in the past which did cost something.

38
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,070
This does not cost you anything.

39
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:34,020
Now Watts's getting set up you can already click on secure to year and there you will probably not have

40
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,560
as many users as I do.

41
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:41,600
No make sure you add at least one new user and I already did this which.

42
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,500
And that's important which has read and write access to any database.

43
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:52,230
You can turn it into an atlas admin but more realistic this year because this will later be the role

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,930
which are no japes application assumes which should be able to read and write our databases but not

45
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,840
to administrate them because we'll not do database administration Frue no chance Dad would be something

46
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,830
our database admin does.

47
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,670
And then for not our app.

48
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,540
So make sure you create such a user.

49
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,240
You can also sign your own password or order generate a secure one.

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,980
Make sure you do save that because you'll need it later.

51
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,360
And then also make sure you have a look at IP wirelessed.

52
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,490
There you see all the IP addresses that are allowed to connect to your mom would to be server.

53
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,630
Now I already got a bunch here that will probably be last for you.

54
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:38,470
Now one thing you should do here is you should add a new IP address as your current IP address.

55
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:44,760
Since the note runs locally on your machine your node app will have this IP address later when you deployed

56
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,240
a node.

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,250
This should of course use the IP address of your server where you deploy it to.

58
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,850
But here you can use your local one so that you can connect and your node app can connect to the server.

59
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:03,320
That's of course a good security feature because this makes sure that no on offer ised access can tap

60
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,280
into your database so your database is now locked down both from our IP perspective but also from a

61
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,540
user perspective.

62
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,700
And now we can wait for it to set up to finish and I'll be back once it did finish.

63
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,780
Now to set up this complete and now we can connect to our mom would it be server from inside our node

64
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:28,440
app ad for this we can click on Connect here and choose a connection method which in our case will be

65
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,170
an application.

66
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,160
Now here we can check I'm using describer and we get this you r l which will need it.

67
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,260
But first of all we need to install them on to be driver in our case for no chase.

68
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,840
You can click on an example down there but I will simply show it to you in our project.
