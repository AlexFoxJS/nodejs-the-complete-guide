00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:07,560
Now in the last lecture we did insert a product into our monkey database which is awesome.

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:13,690
Now I also want to see it and before we actually fetched it in our node application let me show you

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,060
another tool called Compaq's.

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,990
If you click on get long would you be on Mongo to be dot com.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,320
You can choose that and you can download and install it for free as well.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,470
It's a way for Windows Mac OS and Linux.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:32,800
And once you get that installed you can start your Kompas application on your machine.

8
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:38,260
And this essentially is a tool that gives you a graphical user interface to connect to your database

9
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,060
and to interact with it.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:46,780
So let's wait for it starting up here and once it did start up you can connect to it now to connect

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,090
to it.

12
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:52,630
Let's go back to our mulga to be cluster and click connect here and then click connect with mom would

13
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:58,230
it be Atlas choose your operating system and then copied that you are down there.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:08,200
Now one cool thing is if you now quickly close campaigns again and you restarted offer you copied that

15
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,280
you are l.

16
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,400
It should tell you that it detected a connection string.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,100
And if you click yes it will insert the most important pieces here for you.

18
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:23,530
Now you still need to choose how you want to connect to make sure your username is correct and also

19
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,210
entered the password for this user.

20
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:31,210
You need to do this manually all the defaults can be left as they are and you should be able to now

21
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,840
connect to your database.

22
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:40,310
And here is this interesting enough you are to be precise are now connected to the database server.

23
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,010
And here you see a couple of databases two default ones which you don't need to touch and which you

24
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:45,700
shouldn't touch.

25
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:52,240
But then also your own one shop and the shop database here actually has a product collection as you

26
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,050
can see if you look into that product's collection in there.

27
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,480
We can see the documents that are stored in there.

28
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,930
And here is one document we inserted.

29
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,920
So it is one product we added in the last lecture.

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,900
Now you can also insert documents and edit them inside of campus and check out the official comp docs

31
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,850
to learn all about the features you can use here.

32
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,490
I just want to use this as a nice visual support so that we can see our data before we fetch it in our

33
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,380
no doubt.

34
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,600
That being said obviously the data is not that useful to us here.

35
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:33,270
So let's go back to no chats and write some code so that we can use the product data on our shop pages

36
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,800
again which we commented out at the moment.
