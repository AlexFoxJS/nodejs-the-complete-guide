1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,560
So everything works but when clicking add to cart it won't be nice if we don't get stuck here.

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,520
So something seems to be wrong.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,440
If we look at post-cart.

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,030
Well the thing is we never send a response here.

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,970
We do add our product to a card but that's it.

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:26,820
Now in the old code we redirect redirected to slash cart and that is what we should do here too.

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,920
So instead of returning those were salt which doesn't matter.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,140
No one's interested here.

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,320
I just want to call wrests redirect here.

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,910
We're not here but here.

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,950
And then I guess we can return to us to see the result of that operation here if you wanted to.

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,910
But the important part is that we redirect at some point with that.

13
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:51,200
If Lake add to cart here and redirect it to the current page.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,070
Awesome.

15
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,040
Now let's make sure we can the lead card items.

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,280
As always feel free to try this on your own in the next lecture and thereafter we'll do this together.
