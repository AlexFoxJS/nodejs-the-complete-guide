1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,430
So knouted we're able to at faction's update products.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,200
Let's work on the leading them now for deleting you could implement different approaches.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,370
You could add a method to the product class so that you can create a new product object and call delete

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,020
on it just as you called Save on it.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,710
But I will go with a static method and I'll add a static method which I'll name delete by id and where

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,940
I expect a product ID as an argument.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,200
Now in here of course again we need access to the database.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,730
So let's call get D-B to get access to that one central database connection theory and at the start

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:46,020
and then all the debris again it's time to reach out to the products collection and all that collection.

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,990
We want to delete an element.

11
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:54,310
Now as always you'll find more in the official docs and the crud operations.

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,300
If you click on the documents you see that just as we had injured one injured many and so on.

13
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,750
We all have to leave many and delete one now.

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,510
I don't want to delete many products but exactly one solid lead to one product here and you need to

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,370
specify a filter now.

16
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:16,050
So again pass an object where you describe how to find that product.

17
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:21,030
And again will be are boring IOD equal to check here.

18
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,140
Now here product ideas an argument.

19
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:30,230
So we need to convert it to an object id manually again by passing it to the optical constructor.

20
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,860
And now we will go ahead and delete the first element.

21
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,690
It finds that has this criteria fulfilled.

22
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,430
So I will return here.

23
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:48,270
And of course just as before we can add then and catch your if you want we can catch any error and console

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,630
larget and we can also work with the result of this operation.

25
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,940
We could cons a log at all just console log deleted and that will be it.

26
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,370
So now we have to delete by id Methot.

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,720
Now we just need to add it.

28
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,440
So the admin.

29
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,920
Yes control or file here to post delete product outlet's comment it back in.

30
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,680
Or not route.

31
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,960
The action I mean of course we extract the product.

32
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,260
And then here we had a different flow.

33
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,610
I first of all found two products here.

34
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,520
Now we don't do that anymore.

35
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:30,020
We just call product delete by ID instead we pass Toprol ID as a string and then we just have our then

36
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,250
block here which won't receive an argument.

37
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,820
And yet that is it we redirect thereafter.

38
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,350
So let's go back to our application.

39
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:50,840
Let's quickly add a new dummy product with totally invalid and uninteresting data and dat fails.

40
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,020
That's an interesting behavior.

41
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,360
Let's fix that in a second.

42
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:02,620
Let's first of all check if deleting were X I get redirected to a page that is not found yet makes sense

43
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,290
because obviously working in a controller is not enough.

44
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,770
I need to go to my admen routes and comment in that post delete product route.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,670
So after changing dis Let's now click delete and now I get no products here.

46
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:23,150
Let's confirm in column pass by quickly refreshing that page and our product is gone.

47
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,260
So deleting works.

48
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,010
Let's now see what's going wrong when I tried to add that product.
