1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:09,080
We had a very detailed look at how you can use sequel based databases like my sequel to story or application

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:16,730
data and most importantly for us as note developers how you can interact with your mysql database from

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,400
inside.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,730
Note Jaz.

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:26,240
Now sequel based databases are popular are great and are used a lot but there is a number of very popular

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:34,580
alternative which is used heavily and that is no sequel or no sequel based databases especially Mongo

7
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,300
D-B.

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,490
And then this module will have a look at more.

9
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,110
Would it be what it is and how you can start up Monga to be database.

10
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,010
And most importantly of course how you can use it from inside your node code.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,980
So specifically I'll give you a short introduction to what moment it is and why we would use it.

12
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,340
What the difference to sequel is.

13
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,560
I also had a brief discussion about this earlier in the sequel module.

14
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,440
And then most importantly we'll see how we used the so-called moment to be driver.

15
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:09,500
Basically a package we install to interact with Mangu to be from inside our no js applications.

16
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,620
So let's do Maunganui B and Z why it's awesome and why we could use it and how we use it.
