1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:07,300
So we worked on the product model to make the save method more flexible.

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:14,270
And now in the Edmond J as controller in post at a product there we already have code where we find

3
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,760
a product by id and this will work because I find by ID is a method I created in my model.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:27,390
So here we have the product or maybe we should name it product data because here I will now create a

5
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:35,040
new product constant by using my product constructor's and my own product class and there I will pass

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:47,770
my updated title my updated price my updated image your L and my updated description and my ID.

7
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,660
No actually we don't even need find by that anymore.

8
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:59,510
We can just get rid of that and for now all of that and simply create a new product with all the updated

9
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:06,050
information and we now also need to pass the product ID there you just need to make sure that you create

10
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,680
a new one would be object id object.

11
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:17,670
So make sure that at the top of the file you do actually require mongered be and now you can of course

12
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:24,420
also create a new constant named object ID or whatever you want and extract that object id constructor

13
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,240
out off Mongo be like this.

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,900
And then you could just write new object id and reference this basically so we can now go down to post

15
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:42,450
edit product and pass a new object id here with new object id and wrap that Prod. ID you're extracting

16
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:49,310
from the you are l here and wrap that or from the body of the request and wrap that into object ID.

17
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,900
Now we have that new product and now we can simply call product safe because we just modified the safe

18
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,140
method to support both creation and updating.

19
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,620
So let me save all of that.

20
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,100
And let's give this a try.

21
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:13,310
Let's reload that view here maybe change the price to 999 and click Update product.

22
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,490
Now we get a page not found.

23
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:23,670
Let's ignore that for now and let's instead go back to Molly Compaq's and click that refresh.

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,610
I can hear you now that doesn't look like it worked though right.

25
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,490
The price is unchanged but I also did not get an error.

26
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,970
So what's wrong here.

27
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:40,720
Well you need to go to your app and chase routes again and uncomment does post edit product drought

28
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,260
otherwise editing products will not be possible.

29
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:52,140
Now if we load that product to edit again and we change that price now it looks much better or at least

30
00:02:52,180 --> 00:03:00,220
partly if we have a look at more would be Compaq's we see now it looks like I made a mistake with the

31
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:06,400
assignment of values from my description and I can simply add at this your my description.

32
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,920
Now Assembly last you are l and the other way round.

33
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,050
So let me change both and click update here.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,520
Now if we look at this page again it should work.

35
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,870
But the most important thing is our method worked.

36
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,230
Now what did I mess up.

37
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,760
If I go to the admin controller I'm assigning price image you your Elen description well that is in

38
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,690
the wrong order.

39
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,790
It should first be the description and then the image you are l but that was only a little logical mistake

40
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,380
I made.

41
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:42,650
If I edit this again back to twelfth 99 you see now this is working and this also works.

42
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,390
Let's see how it works if I added two fields at the same time.

43
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,870
Does all that works.

44
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:54,470
So this is how we can update a product with the help of Muang with a B and with the help of update 1.
