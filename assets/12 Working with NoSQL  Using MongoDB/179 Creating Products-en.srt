1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,970
So let's make product work again.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,980
And for this will not use the user anymore.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,510
But instead here before we use it then we'll Rieu is that.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,400
So no need to delete it before we do that.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:20,900
We'll use our product model solitaria a new product constant by initialising product again and here

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:29,360
I will simply pass title price description and image you or else so we'll pass all that data into the

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,550
constructor of the product.

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:40,340
Then on this product I can call save and then here to call then I'll go into my model again and I will

9
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,300
return this year.

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:50,140
So we'll return my collection and then this entire command chain because Dad will allow me to will treat

11
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,640
his overall as a promise and change then their offer.

12
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,950
And then there were also redirect.

13
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,690
So now with that if I save debt and I go back to the form and resubmit that I'm actually redirected

14
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,840
to a page which is not found because I commented out all the shop pages.

15
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,390
But if we go back to our service side console we see something interesting.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,620
We see that this here has to be the output of this console log line and the product model where I print

17
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,820
the result of the insert operation and there we see a lot of data about that operation.

18
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:29,690
And for us important if we scroll down to the bottom we see one document was inserted.

19
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:35,990
It received an ID and such an ID is managed automatically by Hmong would it be because every document

20
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,510
needs to have such a underscore ID.

21
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,850
This is a must have and long would you be created on the fly automatically if the object you entered

22
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,040
does not have it.

23
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,410
So we'll use that to generate that ID.

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,770
And then you see the data which we entered all that was stored.

25
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,940
So we can't look into database yet because we're not fetching anything.

26
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,830
We see that are injured one operation was successful and did successfully add a product into the collection

27
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,650
which is of course amazing.
