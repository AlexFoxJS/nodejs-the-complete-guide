1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:09,970
So let's dive back into our project and make sure you are locked out and make sure you download detached

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:16,410
snapshot because there I did add a sign uplink to our navigation bar and click on that.

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:21,610
We also load a sign up page where we should edit the caption on the button by the way.

4
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:27,020
So if you download the hatch code what was added and you can also add this to your own project.

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,730
I did add the sign up each file where I also should change just to sign up so you can simply add deadfall

6
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,700
to your all folder.

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:43,150
I did manipulate or changed navigation each last fall there what I did add is I simply added the sign

8
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,610
up again in menu entry.

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,130
After log in both forward and normal menu and all that for the mobile menu down there.

10
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,230
So basically one list item was added to each menu.

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,460
Does this what I edit in this file.

12
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:02,980
And then I worked on my route STEHR I added two new routes posts sign up and get signed up where I use

13
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,610
my control or get sign up and post sign up actions.

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,830
And in that controller I worked on these actions.

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,300
I edit posts sign up which is an empty placeholder nothing in there.

16
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,370
So that is not that difficult get sign up all is is a pretty simple route there.

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,010
I simply render you off.

18
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:26,170
Sign up view so you can just add this to your existing project or use my attached snapshot and replace

19
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,210
my mom would be you are with yours.

20
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,820
And once you got all that you should be able to have a running application that looks like this with

21
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:40,950
a sign up page that looks like this because now we will use or we will need a way of signing up users.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,530
So let's now start implementing the full authentication flow in this module.

23
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:51,260
And for that first of all make sure that we can create new users then that we can sign users in and

24
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:57,190
sign users out of course that we can then use the information wherever a user is signed.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,380
It was signed out in all our viewers and that we can protect our routes on the service side too because

26
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:09,650
right now even if I'm not signed in what I can do is I can manually wizard admin add product and this

27
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,310
works.

28
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,680
So I can't get there by menu because he hides the menu options but manually visiting this works.

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,660
And there's also something we'll work on in this module.

30
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,620
So let's get there step by step and let's start by adding user sign up in the next lecture.
