1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:08,110
So that's it for this module I'll actually dive into some other indication related things in the next

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:14,470
modules for example we'll add password resetting but these are the basic things you need to know about

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:21,070
all indication you learned what authentication means that it means that not every visitor of your page

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:27,580
can view and do everything that all indication has to happen on the server side to ensure that users

5
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:34,180
don't trick you into thinking they are authenticated and that you Daffer use sessions to stored the

6
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:40,630
authentication status and that you can't protect routes by checking that session controlled log in status

7
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:46,750
right before the request reaches your control or action or the code in general that is executed in a

8
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,580
route.

9
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,310
Now of indication obviously all the is strongly tied to security and providing a good user experience

10
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:01,840
and they offer passwords should absolutely be stored in a hashed form if you store them in plain text.

11
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,700
If your database gets compromised the attackers have full access to your user accounts.

12
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:15,040
Additionally see SRF attacks cross-eyed request forgery attacks are a real issue because your session

13
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,880
can be stolen there so to say and therefore you should implement SRF protection as shown in this module

14
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,110
in any production ready app you're planning to ship.

15
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:32,350
Now for a better user experience you can look into flashing data or messages as we did in this module

16
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,300
into your session store.

17
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:40,380
Flashing means that this data will be removed from the session automatically by a package we use once

18
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:48,280
we used the data and we can use that data to persist data across redirects because redirects technically

19
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:54,420
triggered two different requests or we have the old request redirect and then a new request starts.

20
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,450
If you want to share data cross request as you learned we need to use a session.

21
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,910
So these are the general often occasionally the things you need.

22
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:08,010
And with this knowledge you already get very very far.

23
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:14,500
Now in the next module we'll have a look at how we can send mails from inside our Dode application because

24
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:20,670
we'll need that feature to enhance our application a little bit regarding the authentication so that

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,880
we can also add a password resetting mechanism.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,060
We'll do this in the module there after the next module.

27
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,190
Let's first of all have a look at how we send mails.
