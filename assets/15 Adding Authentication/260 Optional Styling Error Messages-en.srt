1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,120
I'm outputting that error message I just want to style it a little bit now.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:13,790
And for Dad I'll give it a C is this class and it's simply named add user message and then maybe user

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,910
message dash dash air or using some BGM styling here.

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:25,250
That's a SEUS as styling convention or a convention of naming your classes doesn't matter too much.

5
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,790
You can name just where we want the end.

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:32,430
I edit these two classes one to have a general message look and then one for errors because maybe we

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,850
all want to be able to output success messages later.

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,770
So with that let me quickly add this to some see as false and you can skip this lecture if you want.

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,400
In the next lecture you'll find the finished code attached which you can use in the main C of S all

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,320
quickly at this let's say at the bottom of this fall.

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,280
It's up to you right before the media queery maybe I have my user message.

12
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,060
So this is as class I just added here.

13
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:09,400
And let's say such a user message should use a margin auto to be centered get a width of 90 percent

14
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,600
by default.

15
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,720
I'll also set up some styling in case I'm on a bigger screen.

16
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:25,400
Their user message will have all width of let's say 30 REM and then here I'll give it a border of one

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:32,540
pixel Sallet and let's use maybe some some bluish color here maybe not that blue.

18
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:42,540
Well basically which ever blue color you want maybe does one and a background color.

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,580
Also use a blue here also a different blue so some light bluish color here.

20
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,290
So General Info message should have maybe some neutral colors so some blue like this.

21
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,000
And let's see how that looks like.

22
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,470
With it at it let me try entering invalid email again.

23
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,210
Looks like that.

24
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,280
Nah not too pretty.

25
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,150
That should be much lighter.

26
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,420
I also want to have some padding in here.

27
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:20,120
Maybe one ram and let's give it some rounded corners as well.

28
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,860
Now with dad if we enter the invalid email that looks much better.

29
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,780
Ok so now this is my general info message list maybe also to send her a text if we want to.

30
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:38,490
And now let's give it is air or we're basically with dash dash air or at sea class I added to this specific

31
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:46,620
box in my log in screen and there I will change the border color to be red and the background should

32
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,870
be a light red.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,970
So let's start with red and then tear Turnus in for a light red.

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:02,460
And now if we try this again now it looks like this OK so this could be the error message we're outputting

35
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:02,850
here.

36
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:08,310
You could also turn the text red if you want so you could also say text color should be red here maybe

37
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,560
and reduce to padding maybe 2.5 that could look a bit better.

38
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,160
So invalid email or password.

39
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,150
That looks good.

40
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,580
Now I always have that stick around.

41
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,420
Now reason for Dad is if I go back.

42
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:29,240
Error message seems to be set to something even if we're not having a message in there and that is something

43
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,620
I'll check in the next lecture.
