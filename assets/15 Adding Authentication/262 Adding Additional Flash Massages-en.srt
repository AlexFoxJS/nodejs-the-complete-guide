1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,770
So were you successful.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:09,720
We added our flash message here when we used an email which we did not find.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,870
Now obviously if we have a password that does not match here where we redirect to log in I also want

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,570
to flash my invalid email or password message onto the session.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,760
So it is a great place because we now save this on the logon screen.

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:33,210
I might have a valid email but an invalid password and I get this error message with valid credentials.

7
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,700
It of course works fine though.

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:42,490
Now we could also do something when signing up because when signing up I'm checking with an email address

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,930
already exists.

10
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,260
Well before redirecting here I can also output something there.

11
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,350
Email exists already.

12
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,270
Please pick a different one.

13
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:04,060
Something like that we now save debt and I enter the e-mail address which indeed does already exist.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,710
Well then I redirect it without having any effect.

15
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,350
And that makes sense because we flashed a message but I'm not outputting it.

16
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,080
So we need to go to the logon page and copy that code for outputting an error message and then go to

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,060
sign up and there above the form.

18
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,540
Let's also output the error message here.

19
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,020
But of course for this to work we also need to extract that when loading the sign up page.

20
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,280
So that code which I'm using and get log in to render my error message I need to get in get sign up

21
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,800
to.

22
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:41,300
And then there I also need to pass this error message variable Ceuta view which holds that message I'm

23
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,090
extracting.

24
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,810
I realize we can't display it even though we flash it into the session.

25
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:52,010
So now if dat Let's try again let's reuse a passenger email that already exists.

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,720
And now I get this error if I do create a valid user with a valid email.

27
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,730
This works however.

28
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,860
So now we quickly check our users collection.

29
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,070
We see that was added.

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,220
So these are some messages.

31
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,260
I can flash onto the screen you could add more.

32
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,710
For example after logging out you could also output some confirmation for that but this should do it

33
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,620
for now was a nice practice and improves the user experience a little bit.
