1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,130
Knouted we are able to sign up and sign in.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,370
We have to work on route protection.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,740
We already have a set up where we only show the menu options we should be able to interact with.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:22,020
But even when I log out and they offer Mei's session is gone even when I do that I can still manually

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,200
enter admin at product and reach that page and I could even try to create a product here.

6
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:33,900
I would fail then because there would be no user object on the back and where I tried to get locked

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,610
in user.

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,360
But this is not user experience.

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,280
You want to offer.

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,130
We don't even want to be able to load this page if we're not locked in.

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,480
And for that we need to protect our routes.

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,490
Now how do we protect routes.

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,990
Well to protect routes we want to check where the user is authenticated before we render back.

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,260
Let's say at product page.

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:02,790
So an admin and the admin controller in get at product which loads that page before we rendered it.

16
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:08,220
Page I want to check if in the request session is locked in a set.

17
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:15,450
And to be precise I want to check if it's not set because if this is not true the user is not locked

18
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,180
in.

19
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,490
And if the user is not locked in then I want to redirect.

20
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,470
Let's say to the logon page like this.

21
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:31,720
So then since I return here this code will not execute and it won't load the added product page.

22
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,930
So now let me try to reload this page.

23
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,690
Keep in mind I'm not locked in and I'm on the logon page.

24
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,370
So this works.

25
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,350
I am redirected here because sessional locked in is not set.

26
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,910
On the other hand if I do a log in now.

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,310
So if I do enter my valid credentials you're try to access add product.

28
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,570
This does work because now I make it past it check.

29
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,740
Now this is a code we could add to every route which we want to protect but adding it like this is a

30
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,420
bit cumbersome.

31
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:10,800
So let me show you a better way of protecting our routes we're a more scalable way in the next lecture.
