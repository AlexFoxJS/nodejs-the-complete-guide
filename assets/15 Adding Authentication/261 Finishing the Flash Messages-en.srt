1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:08,200
So I added a messagebox and the last lecture you can download the finished word not the entire project

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,010
attached.

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,070
I simply added C as this classes to my div which surrounds the message.

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,200
And then I worked on these classes and the mains is as follows.

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:25,510
I added user message and user message error and also added some user message entry to my desktop sys

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,770
classes so you can add this manually from the attached code.

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:36,790
Now one thing you'll notice is that even if you load the log in page regularly you'll see an empty box

8
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,540
here.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,980
So even if no message is flashed it looks like error message is not set to undefined and therefore let's

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:52,780
quickly go to off and let's simply console log request flash error or to see what's in there that's

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,040
causing this to not be undefined.

12
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,690
Basically if I reload this page I see it's an empty array.

13
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,520
And if I do enter something here you.

14
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,490
It's an array of messages.

15
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:17,690
So in the end what do we want to do is we want to extract our message here is equal to request flash

16
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:28,530
error or now if message length is now greater than zero then I know I have a message ender.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,310
So now actually turn into a variable by using LET here and then I can set message equal to message the

18
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:43,150
first element because I want to retrieve that overwise altered message equal to null and now down there

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:53,600
we can use the message and pass that as I erro message we now safe that don't have the box you're due

20
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,120
and or something invalid.

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,600
We do see the error message though.

22
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,400
But if I go to the logon page regularly without an error I don't see it.

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,070
So this is now how we can use these flash messages and output them in a nice air box.

24
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,110
Now here's a challenge for you.

25
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,700
Find some other places in the log in and sign up screen.

26
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,870
Really what makes sense to flash messages onto the screen.

27
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,980
We'll do it together in the next lecture.
