1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,460
So what is authentication.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,910
While we obviously got our user using our application interacting with our dues and we get the server

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,060
and also database with which our server works.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,430
These are all things we worked with in this course already.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,080
Now in our application we might have different routes different actions.

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,480
A user can do.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,260
We might be able to view all products to create and manage products or to place orders.

8
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:37,060
Now obviously we can do more things in our application but these are just some examples.

9
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:43,650
Now the idea behind authentication is that not all these actions are available to every user of our

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,710
application.

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:53,160
And now here's one important thing with user I don't mean locked in user I mean simply a person with

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,610
getting our page Wisting localhost free.

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,870
And in our case here later of course the domain under which we deployed it.

14
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:07,590
So I'm not talking about locked in users but really just people using our page and such anonymous users

15
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,120
who are not locked in should not be able to do all these things.

16
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,610
They certainly should be able to view all products just as you are able to view all products on Amazon.com

17
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,320
even if you're not locked in.

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,760
We want to allow this in our shop too.

19
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,990
But there are other things like for example here creating products managing products and placing orders

20
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,320
which should only be available to locked in users and not to every Wiznitzer of our page because in

21
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,660
order to buy a product you need to be locked in and in order to create a new product you also need to

22
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,360
be locked in.

23
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:47,970
Because in our application we of course connect a product to a locked in user we match to two things.

24
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,110
And this is what we need authentication for.

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,790
We need to be able to differentiate between anonymous users who are not locked in and locked in users

26
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,750
and we need to provide a flow of view and the back in logic that allows people visiting our page to

27
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:10,500
sign up and then to sign in and then we can use sessions as I showed it to you in the last module to

28
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:19,030
store the information whether a user is signed in and well let him interact with the page across requests.

29
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,370
This is the idea behind authentication.

30
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,220
Now how is it implemented.
