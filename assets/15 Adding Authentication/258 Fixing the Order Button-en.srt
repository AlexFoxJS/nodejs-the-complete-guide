1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,530
So now it seems our protection was added.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:11,770
Let me quickly fix that error where I was not able to order an item and their pop user name is required

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,500
ISDE issue which is frozen.

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:20,220
Let's quickly check the shop controller and their post order and in there I indeed store the username

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,080
and I'm not storing to user name any more here.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,720
When signing up users only have to email.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:34,150
So here we could store the e-mail for our user with request user e-mail on the order like this.

8
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:40,600
So instead of the name I now store the e-mail of the user in here or you also Amadis isn't just a user

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,420
id whatever you want.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,960
Now in our order model This means that here I also don't expect the name but the email which still is

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,820
a string and still is required.

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,500
So this is a tiny change that needs to be done to fix that issue.

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,320
And if I now go back to products and I add this to my card and I add it to my card.

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,720
Again let's say that I have to order this.

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,000
Now this works.

16
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,390
And the cart is empty.

17
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,920
So this was just a little note something that was required.

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,770
Let's log out.

19
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,610
This all works.

20
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,080
Does this does bug fixed.
