1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:09,150
So he added see is or if token protection but it will only work if we are visiting or get it next page.

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,930
Now we want to have such a token and by the way also our authentication status on every page we render

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,910
what we can do to get it onto every page is we can remove it from our render function here and instead

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,280
tell express chase.

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,850
And does this now totally unrelated from D.C. Is there anything tell express to us that we have some

6
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,190
data that should be included in every rendered view.

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:43,760
We'll do Disney-ABC J.S. file and there after this middleware where we extract the user.

8
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:51,180
But before all are relics I'll add another middleware normal middleware with our normal middleware function

9
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:58,080
with the free arguments and in there we can use a special feature provided by express JS We can access

10
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,420
a special field on the response the locals field.

11
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:09,360
This allows us to set local variables that are passed into the views local Simply because while they

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,100
will only exist in the views which are rendered.

13
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:19,770
So there we can add our is authenticated property which I removed from the render function where I X-ists

14
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,570
request session is locked in.

15
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:34,030
And I can also add my or f token variable which I get from request C is f token from this function.

16
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,770
So now for every request that is executed these two fields would be set for the views that are rendered

17
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:46,700
and then we have to call next so that we are able to continue with this if we go back and we reload

18
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,670
this page seems to work seems to work.

19
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,480
And now let's all try signing in where we also have a post request.

20
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,040
And now does fails.

21
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,700
And how do you know why it well.

22
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,600
Because I do pass my token into all views but in the views I still need to use it.

23
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,160
So for that we have to repeat the code we added to the navigation.

24
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,720
We need that hidden input with that name and that value.

25
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,760
And we have to add it into all our forms and that is something you just have to do.

26
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:24,730
So for example here in the Add to Cart Post forum we need Deadhead input to see is our token and also

27
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:33,580
an admin added product we need somewhere in that form that hidden token input the same for our all for

28
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:39,290
all it's of course when logging in we need to hit and put it the same for signing up.

29
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,370
This is required in the products Jasin the admin folder there.

30
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,490
We also have a forum for deleting a product we need to token in there too.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,820
And in a shop in the cart we all have a delete card item button when you didn't put there as well.

32
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:03,160
And also down there for the order now button this also sends a post request and we need our hidden input

33
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,860
there are C S R F tokin on index Ejay S..

34
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,280
We don't need an add to cart.

35
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:15,830
I just added it so there we already have it in the product list page it's the same and it was added

36
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,470
to add to cart and all the product detail page.

37
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,570
I also only have to cart on the orders page here.

38
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,360
We all have no post for him.

39
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,230
So now we should have this tokin everywhere where we needed.

40
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:36,990
And if you save all that and you now go back to your let's say starting page and use it to logon page

41
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,470
and you do log in.

42
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,640
This now works because we have that token we also can add items to the cart.

43
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,880
We can also order them.

44
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,350
Well there is an area which you will fix in a second.

45
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,110
So for now let's not order them but let's delete them.

46
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,970
This works and generally just works.

47
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:03,120
Let me fix this bug here which is not too late to see SRF token in the next Lechter real quick but this

48
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:08,830
hopefully and that is the main takeaway here shows you how to use Sezer of protection and this is a

49
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,780
crucial thing which you have to add to any production ready application.

50
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,030
It's not optional.

51
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,880
Otherwise you'll have a huge security issue on your page.

52
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,790
You need to add this to ensure that your sessions don't get stolen.
