1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,770
Let's first of all start with the payment process how does this work.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,020
Well it's a pretty long process.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,050
We start by collecting the payment method.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,170
So the credit card data typically we don't have to fight it is to credit card data.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:15,780
Correct.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,920
Is it expired.

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,590
Is the number correct.

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,250
We don't have to charge it and offer we charged we have to manage payments.

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,730
So that includes things like fraud protection.

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,850
Also managing disputes and so on.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,440
And last but not least we of course have to Prose's the order in our app so in our research side code

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,880
for example that we stored in the database there.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,870
Now all the payment related things here are pretty complex tasks both from a legal and the technical

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,490
side and therefore typically you outsource them.

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:53,370
And by the way even very big companies outsource this Strype is a very popular company offering payment

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,090
services.

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,180
It offers a great integration it's super easy to add to any application as you will see in this module.

18
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,240
How does it work.

19
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,180
Well we have our client and our server.

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,380
So that is all the code we own and we wrote and then the client will collect credit card data.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,170
We'll do that with the help of Strype and we'll send it to the Strype servers which are not owned by

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:20,040
us but by that company to validate that input once it is valid Strype will return a token to us which

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,120
basically and or which includes that credit card data and confirmation that it is correct.

24
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,380
We sent that token to our server.

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:36,810
So to our code and in our code we create a charge or we charge this payment method then with the help

26
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,950
of Strype again.

27
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:44,880
So we create a payment object a charge object we sent that to stripe with that token and with our price

28
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,620
included and Strype will then do the actual charging to the actual managing.

29
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:55,830
And we will get a response once this is done and then we can also continue with our code and added this

30
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,320
or stored in the database and so on.

31
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,270
So this is generally how that will work.

32
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,300
Now let me walk you through that step by step.
