1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,400
To add payment to our application let's work on that.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,940
Check out Ejaz fall with which we never worked thus far.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,510
I want to go there before I actually placed an order when I click on order now in my cart so I'll go

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,140
to this page first.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,800
For that I'll copy the content of cart.

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,520
Each has added and checkout Aegeus to make sure that I have my default hat.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,930
I'll get rid of that style sheet though I don't need it here.

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,840
I want to include the navigation.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,490
The main content will be totally different though.

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,750
I will keep my body however so it might end here.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,540
So with that I have everything set up to have a basic checkout page.

12
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,410
Now let's first of all make sure we reached it before we start adding stripe.

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,740
For that we need a new route of course in a shop G-S fall.

14
00:00:52,790 --> 00:01:04,130
Here we have our create order route and in the end what I need is a new router I get route which we

15
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,600
can check out there.

16
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:12,800
I want to be authenticated because that we can only buy something if we are locked in let's say and

17
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:18,140
then I'll use my shop controller and there get check out which is action I still have to create an in

18
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:26,070
that get check out page 10 will have the possibility to create an order and so on.

19
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:33,730
So for now let's just add this and let's work on our controller down on our shop controller and there

20
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,940
I need a get check out Methot.

21
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:44,320
So maybe here before Post order because logically comes prior to that I'll have get check out with request

22
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:53,880
response and next and in there I want to render my check out page so we can of course grab one of our

23
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,420
other Rander functions heater

24
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,090
rendered that here I will render shop slash checkout.

25
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,720
The pov can be checked out but doesn't really matter we don't have an obligation.

26
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,000
Do we want to highlight here we can check out as a text.

27
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,290
And of course we had some data for to check out.

28
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,110
Now what do I want to return here.

29
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,140
Well endian.

30
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:23,050
I will need the same data as I have in my cart so I need my products here which I do have in the cart

31
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,810
so I can actually copy that entire code from get to cart.

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:34,640
I guess and add this year and now just make sure we use shop.

33
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,480
Check out lbf check out and here.

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:47,020
Check out but besides that I also need to calculate the total Let's say so total sum or whatever you

35
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,780
want to name it and that total sum of course can be retrieved from our product data.

36
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,210
Because in the cart or in the products here we have in the cart.

37
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,410
You have to keep in mind that products is in their range of products where we have the quantity and

38
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:09,550
then a product ID field with detailed data about the products because we populate this product ID field

39
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:20,030
with the detailed product data so therefore the total sum can be generated by looping through all products.

40
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,480
So you can do products for each

41
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,620
and create a new variable total which is zero initially.

42
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:38,490
And then there total is equal plus equal does shortcuts to add something to the existing total So total

43
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:47,170
plus the product and then there is a quantity field times the product product ID price and then its

44
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,270
just total which I passed to my view.

45
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,780
So that's all the data you should need to check out you.

46
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,010
So now back in March check out each fall.

47
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,330
Now I can indeed grab that on the list for rendering a list of items.

48
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,800
Like does I'll go for all my products.

49
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,900
I'll remove the delete button though it's too late at this point let's say we can of course always cancel

50
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,350
the check out process if we want to though.

51
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,810
Actually I'll delete this entire form therefore this is my unordered list and below that we can add

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,530
a death with age to tag of total.

53
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,690
And then your output total sum.

54
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,310
Now let's have a look at that and to have a look.

55
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:36,050
I need to make sure that cart Ejaz when you click order now I don't submit this form here.

56
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,960
So we'll actually comment this out.

57
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,950
We don't need data anymore.

58
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:49,700
But instead I want to have a normal anchor tag here where I say Order now where I simply point at slash

59
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,310
checkout.

60
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:57,850
So this new route we added and I'll just give Does a class of button to look at it like a button with

61
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,670
all that added.

62
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,830
Let's go back to our page.

63
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:09,740
Let's go to products here maybe add to the cart and click order now and does this now.

64
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,420
Well a page here.

65
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,250
Now it's not looking super beautiful I'd say.

66
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:20,520
I need to include dead carts as fall again because since I'm reusing the rest of the code here we could

67
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,130
create our own style sheet but I want to keep this relatively short since I'm using all that.

68
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,720
I of course all a one to use the same Stahl's.

69
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,860
Now if I reload this check out page here this is looking OK.

70
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:40,080
The total could be placed in the middle maybe we can do that by giving this Dave a glass off centered

71
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:47,630
which is a utility class and it's early and of course and now we have this checkout page.

72
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:52,100
Again you can always work on the visuals but it's not so much about the visuals here.

73
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:58,020
So we have this total and now I want to add Strype and for that let's first of all set up an account

74
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,350
with them.
