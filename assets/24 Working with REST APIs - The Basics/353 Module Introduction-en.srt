1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:08,740
You already learned a lot about note Jay asks and how to build amazing applications with it and the

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,870
Express framework it builds up on know genius.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:19,490
You'll learn a lot about reaching out databases handling requests sending responses rendering templates

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,130
working with files a lot of crucial things that you will need for any node application you're going

5
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,380
to build.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,860
Now I want to move away from one important thing that we always did thus far and that's the rendering

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,680
of templates with Ejay S..

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:44,290
It's a common thing to do that in a lot of node applications but there also is a very popular alternative

9
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:51,350
kind of or a very common over kind of node application that you will work with or that you will build

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,810
as a web developer.

11
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,280
And that are rest.

12
00:00:54,290 --> 00:01:02,060
API is now in this module you will learn what exactly arrest API eyes are why you would use or built

13
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:09,250
them instead of the classic node express application that we built thus far where we rendered the use.

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:16,220
You will learn what the core rest concepts and principles are and we'll build our first rest API in

15
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,400
this module too.

16
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:23,150
So let's dive in and let's understand what rest your eyes are and why we would well use them.
