1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:07,800
Were able to parse incoming request bodies with the help of the body parts or package which is pretty

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,550
neat.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,640
But right now as I mentioned this middleware always executes not just for post requests but all to get

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,210
requests what can we do regarding that.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:25,440
Well instead of the app use we can also use apt get dessous basically app use it has the same syntax

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,480
as app use.

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,670
We can use a POV or don't use a POV but it only will fire for incoming get requests.

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:38,080
So does this a novel form of filtering besides filtering for the Poth apt get allows us to filter or

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,750
forget requests.

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,800
And on the same page we all got app post to filter for incoming post requests and just by changing this

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,660
word does middleware will now only trigger for incoming post requests with this path and not forget

12
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,650
requests.

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:03,500
So if I save this and I go to slash product you see I get hello from Express.

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,930
So I don't end up here in the way I entered slash product but it was a get request.

15
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:18,300
But if I send a post request frood that form I have an app product if I do this year book to you'll

16
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,320
see we get this output.

17
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,850
So we clearly made it into this middleware due to our filtering.

18
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,710
So this is a novel way of using that middleware function instead of use which will work with all the

19
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,410
methods.

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,870
We can also use GET or POST to filter for these.

21
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:41,790
And additionally you all have to lead patch and put which are over HTP were apps which we'll use later

22
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,350
in the course because we can't really use them from a normal aged him document.
