1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:09,160
Were successful let's add it together or add a new h to him l fall in the news and I'll name it for

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,730
Ford or h tim l.

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,180
But the name is totally up to you.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:18,190
Well it has to be a html file of course and then create a new age HTML5 skeleton with the help of visuals

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,210
to you code here and then you're all named is.

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,330
Page Not Found.

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,090
That sounds like a fitting title.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,080
And now you can get of course really creative your.

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,480
I will in the end just add H-1 tag where whereas say Page Not Found.

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,450
Obviously you can add more content here if you want.

11
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,040
Now I want to returned his h tim l file.

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:46,560
When ever we make it into dis middleware and therefore again I should send a file here.

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:53,560
But obviously I want to construct the path with the help of the POF module to make it work on all operating

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,400
systems.

15
00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:04,300
So required a POF year and then go down there send and don't send but send a file and that file will

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,450
use a POV with which we construct here with their name.

17
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,060
And now here's a gotcha.

18
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,760
We already are in the project folder here because we're in actually yes.

19
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,570
So we don't need to go up a level here because we already are in the root folder.

20
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:27,470
Instead here we can go right away into the folder and then served four or four aged him file like this.

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,680
We also still want to set his status code because we still have a 4 0 for error.

22
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:41,530
If you now save this and you enter any random route that doesn't exist you should see that page not

23
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,850
found being served.

24
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,230
And you see that 404 error are being sent back to.

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,580
So does this now working to you.

26
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:55,450
And does this now a way better well way of serving the soul but styling would also be nice wouldn't

27
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:55,850
it.

28
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,330
So let's work on this over the next Electra's.
