1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,330
Our age team all pages look pretty boring and obviously dessous know of course.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,330
I got one if you want to learn more about seems as though but that's just a little side note.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:18,450
But this is no it is of course but still it's important to understand how you can serve C S S in your

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,500
node apps too.

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,510
Because typically you have C S S and also a javascript code in your apps.

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,580
Now let's start simple.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:34,080
I'm on the slash page here so on shop h tim L and let's add some styling here with good old style Tex

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,740
in the head section and does this Nottoway will keep it.

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:43,290
Does it just so that we can work on it and auto update this because importing an external style file

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,390
wouldn't work at the moment to spoil the fun already.

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,320
Now ask before you can skip this lecture.

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,070
If you don't want to write dishtowels together with me and you'll find it attached to the next doctor.

13
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,620
Otherwise let's do this together.

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,230
So let's start stalling this and let's start with the header.

15
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,070
Now I want to target the elements directly instead.

16
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,010
This will be my main navigation or my main header.

17
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,260
Let's give it a classmate however.

18
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,010
Header.

19
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:17,180
This will be the main header neth And if you're wondering about the strange CS's class name I'm using

20
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,450
a styling system named BVM.

21
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,760
More on that can be learned in that C as s course I mentioned or of course you can google SEUS SBM.

22
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,520
It's a certain way of naming your classes to avoid double class names.

23
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:42,100
Basically here I'll have my main header whoops head header item list and here I'll have my main header

24
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,620
items like this and you can of course named as However you want.

25
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:50,110
So these are a bunch of CS's classes that should help us with styling.

26
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,030
Now let's start with the header.

27
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:57,880
The header should have a width of 100 percent to take the full width of the page and let's say it should

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,680
have a height of 56 pixels.

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:10,310
Or if you want to work in R.E.M. which has certain Vonta just we could also go with Freethought 5 RPM.

30
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:17,200
Now let's all give it nice background color and here you're really free I'll not stick to red but now

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,980
I can hover over this and use this nice color picker and pick any color you want.

32
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:29,530
Now I'll try to pick a nice yellow golden ish orange colors something like this.

33
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,210
Maybe if you click on RGV it will also convert to a hex code.

34
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:39,880
So let's use debt and of course the class is not Hetter but main header and now if is saved us and go

35
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,500
back and reload.

36
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,800
We got that looks better now.

37
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,980
There is some some padding in the bodies.

38
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:52,210
Let's actually define that we want to have no padding and no margin.

39
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:59,230
I think it's a margin that we don't want to have that looks at this looks almost better.

40
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,180
We still got some margin here at the top.

41
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:07,220
Does this coming from our list in here though that some margin call it missing doing its job here.

42
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,870
Now let's also get rid of that by now.

43
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,590
Also styling our main header.

44
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,320
Tim list.

45
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,770
Let's copy that.

46
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,230
Add a class here.

47
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:24,690
Set the list style to nonne and remove any margin and padding.

48
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,990
We might have year that looks better now.

49
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,000
Obviously the items are not looking nice.

50
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:39,150
For this I will actually change the display here to flex to use flex box for de-list and then style

51
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,580
our items here a bit on these items.

52
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,780
For now I'll remove all margin and padding them I'd have reload.

53
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,960
Now thanks to flex books they're sitting next to each other.

54
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,640
Now let's also style our links in there.

55
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,420
So main hador item.

56
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:06,190
Any nested anchor tag should have no text decoration and the color of white may be looks a bit better

57
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:06,700
now.

58
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,020
Where Diggles centering would also be nice.

59
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:16,600
And for that I'll go back to the main Hetter execution back to the main had are Navier let's add a class

60
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,720
for dads too.

61
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:23,290
And here all first of all he has a height of 100 percent because this is a child element of the main

62
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:28,840
header and therefore it should take all its height and this will all be display.

63
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:35,020
Flex now and we can center items vertically with a line items centered.

64
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,950
With this device save that and reload this page.

65
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,250
Now it is centered.

66
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,180
Now let's add some padding to our main header.

67
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,560
For this let's go here add a padding top and bottom.

68
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,910
I don't need padding but left and right maybe 1.5 RLM something like this.

69
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,440
On mobile phone also still ok I'd say.

70
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,110
Let's all change the global fund Bytheway.

71
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,100
So in the body.

72
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,200
All set.

73
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,430
Fun family to send Sarath for now.

74
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,560
Looks a bit nicer than the surf font I think.

75
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:15,050
And now I want to have some spacing between my navigation items for sale.

76
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:24,790
Let's actually go to the main header item and let's add a margin to the left and right of one REM like

77
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,400
that.

78
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,430
And for now this will do.

79
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,560
Now little Huberty fact for the links maybe.

80
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:39,870
So let's all go your main had or item habere and Main had or I'd active and that's all the define a

81
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:45,610
rule which would apply FDA anchor has an active clause attached to it.

82
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,890
And there I want to set the color.

83
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:59,070
Q Well we have this nice little yellow touchier so we could go into the bluish direction here.

84
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,700
Maybe like this purplish color.

85
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,110
Let's let's see how that looks like.

86
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,100
Not too shabby.

87
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,430
So let's go with that.

88
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:14,580
And now since we have that act of class rule here on shop H L where disliked is active we can actually

89
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,650
add the act of class here and you will learn how to set that dynamically later and of course too of

90
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,580
course.

91
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,490
So now does is active now for the main section.

92
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,410
It's all a style this.

93
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:34,620
Here I will define a general rule for main that I want to have a padding of let's say one in all directions

94
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,180
and now this is to stop when I go with.

95
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:47,820
Now let's also of course work on the admin adds product styling here and we can simply copy the entire

96
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,670
style object from the shop.

97
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:55,790
H tim l fall in the ad product h HTML file and this will already get us pretty far.

98
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,030
Now one thing we should change in ad product we should of course add all these classes so we can basically

99
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,430
copy that header.

100
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,650
And later we will also learn how to reuse it across files.

101
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,370
By the way let's copy that header.

102
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,280
By the way that auto formatting I'm doing occasionally can be set up in the preferences by going to

103
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,280
the keyboard shortcuts and searching for format document desists a shortcut I am using here but that's

104
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,750
just a side note.

105
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,780
So here we now all have to change the act of class.

106
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:35,020
It's not on the shop link here but of course it should go onto the add product link and with that if

107
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,840
I now reload this page looks way better.

108
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,820
Now let's work on the form here too.

109
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:50,500
And for this I want I go to my form give it a class of product form maybe the name is up to you.

110
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:57,500
Add a little div with which to give a class of form control and indebt div.

111
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:07,270
All insert does import here and also add a label for the title get the title as a label on it give that

112
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:14,950
input DVD titles so that it matches the label for accessibility reasons simply.

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,130
And now let's stall this to four days.

114
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,120
All use my form control.

115
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:31,820
So does KLOS I added to to just rounding Dith and here I want to make sure that a label as well as input

116
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:38,270
which is nested in a form control use as a display of type block so that it takes the full away level

117
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,350
with.

118
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,720
And also want to style the input then.

119
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,510
So the input here should have a border of one pixel Sallet.

120
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:54,720
And then I will reuse stat yellow color we used for the header the font should be inherit that so that

121
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,350
it uses a default font family and so on.

122
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,920
And I'll give it a little border radius of like two pixels maybe let's see how that looks like or border

123
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,570
radius if I now reload this doesn't look too bad.

124
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,350
Let's now also work on the button for this.

125
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:19,140
I will set up a generic button style here for now.

126
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,970
Inherits debt default font.

127
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,600
Give it a border of one pixel Sallet and it is light gray.

128
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:32,710
A background of white maybe.

129
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:41,390
Maybe give it a blackboard or he or simply and a border radius of free pixels.

130
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,120
Now let's see how that looks like.

131
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,600
It's OK but let's reuse the yellow color here actually.

132
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,090
And let's also get the text that yellow color.

133
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:59,120
Additionally I want to make sure that we assign the pointer a Kirsner to get this hand cursor when hovering

134
00:09:59,180 --> 00:09:59,890
over it.

135
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:08,040
And last but not least I want to have some spacing but we my form control div and the button.

136
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:15,970
So on the form control itself I'll add some margin to top and bottom off.

137
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,650
Let's say one REM and Cyril left and right.

138
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,810
So it looks like that.

139
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,370
And I think for the button maybe you to go with the purple colors instead.

140
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,690
Should be easier to read.

141
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:34,810
And let's all assign a hover and active state for that button.

142
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:43,240
And when it is active I just want to set the background color to purple and the text color to white.

143
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:43,620
Then

144
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,300
now it looks like this.

145
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,810
And this doesn't look too shabby.

146
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,160
We can go with that I guess we can always work on this and we will continue to work on this for the

147
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,000
course.

148
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,530
But for now this is good.

149
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,010
Let's now centered the entire forum.

150
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:04,190
And for Dad I assigned the product form class to to form.

151
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:15,400
So here I want to give it as a width of let's say 30 REM a max width of 100 percent or Also 90 percent

152
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,630
in case we're on the mobile.

153
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,510
You give it a margin of auto does will automate center it horizontally.

154
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,470
And now just make sure that the input and so on take the available space.

155
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,520
Let's reduce this 20 actually I think Ferdie's a bit too much.

156
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,700
And on the form control for Laili an input.

157
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,950
I'll give it a width of 100 percent.

158
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,690
And now this looks much better.

159
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,970
Now I'm not happy with the white text here now to think about it.

160
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:50,580
So let's actually go to the header and change to white link text to Bleck Let's see how that looks like

161
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,050
yeah I think I prefer that.

162
00:11:54,050 --> 00:12:02,520
So let's actually take that and also add it to shop h tim L. so that we have the black color there too.

163
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,960
And I think the purple could be a little bit darker.

164
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:11,440
So let's now also go to the hovering and active stall here.

165
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:20,530
And make this a darker purple and replaced the purple in all occurrences with that color style.

166
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,090
I'm using a multi-select feature.

167
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,010
The idea here to do that quickly.

168
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,990
And of course also search and replace to do that reload.

169
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,960
Yeah I think that is a bit better now.

170
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,490
You can always tweet this to your needs.

171
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,070
It's not a C is s course here.

172
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,870
I just want to have some basic styling that we can use.

173
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,280
So this is the style with which we'll go from now on and which will of course continue to tweak.

174
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:51,790
Now one thing we should also do now let's copy that style from the shop age him alcohol and put it into

175
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,120
the 4 or 4 edge to melt fall here.

176
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:01,580
Because there I also want to take the header and copy that into there because I don't just want to have

177
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,800
the page not found thing.

178
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:11,210
I also want to show the header so that now if I do enter some route which does not exist like this we

179
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,340
also got the head or dare.

180
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,230
And we can at least leave that route though we can't because I obviously got an error.

181
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:17,910
Indeed you are l.

182
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:23,320
That should be adman's flash at product.

183
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:28,030
Let's fix that everywhere here including our form of course.

184
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,580
Like Dat.

185
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:43,900
And now if I reload we can navigate around just fine here and try adding a book that seems to work.

186
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,110
And with that we get the styling in there we get the basic h tim l Mark up.

187
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:53,750
But of course regarding the styling the issue is staed it's all in our html files would be nice to have

188
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,820
some external falls for that wouldn't it.
