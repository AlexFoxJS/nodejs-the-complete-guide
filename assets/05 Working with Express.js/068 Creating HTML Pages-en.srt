1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:07,790
So knouted we had a very close look at the whole express middleware thing and how routeing works and

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,900
express and how we can use that to our advantage how we can filter routes and so on.

3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,930
Let's actually start working on what we serve to the user.

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:23,540
Thus far it has always been some dummy HDMI content but you're probably not in the course to just learn

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,430
how to build dummy HVM mal content.

6
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:32,690
So let's return some real HVM files to the user that awls don't look like crap.

7
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,380
For this all create a new folder in my project and I'll name it views.

8
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,920
Now that name is up to you.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:46,160
You can also name that folder whatever you want but in that course we will slowly go towards the MVC

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:52,340
model view controller structure and I will explain what this is a little bit later.

11
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,180
One part of it is that we manage our views.

12
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:02,360
So what we serve to the user in one place of our application in the views folder you now the view is

13
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,750
will just be a bunch of HVM files though.

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,600
So we'll create a new file and that will be my shop Daut aged HTML file.

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:19,700
It's file I want to serve for users visiting just slash and I also want to have my ad product fall here.

16
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:27,680
So at ad product or aged him all later by the way in case you already know the concept of templating

17
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:34,620
engines will use these two so that we can dynamically add content into th tim outfalls.

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,780
But for now let's just start with these files.

19
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,420
So let's start here and add product h tim L and now here's one important note.

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,270
If you're not interested in writing that HDMI code you can skip this lecture now and find the finished

21
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,480
HVM code attached to this and that the next lecture.

22
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,980
So if you want to skip.

23
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:01,220
You can do that and just follow along in the next lecture where I will provide that finished H.T. of

24
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:01,920
all the code.

25
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,730
Otherwise let's now create it together.

26
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,060
So in this ad product h HTML file.

27
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:12,910
I'll now create a new h tim L5 skeleton and visuals to do code helps you with that.

28
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:20,660
As you saw if you just type H Tim L It should open does pop up if it doesn't you can Forsett by typing

29
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:27,200
or by hitting control and space and then navigate to h tim L5 with the arrow keys and hit enter and

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,610
it gives you this nice skeleton which basically defines a basic Well HVM elth skeleton.

31
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,460
Now here all change the title to add product and then the body there.

32
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,720
I now want to have my forum.

33
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:46,610
I don't just want to have to form in there though I also want to have some navigation bar that allows

34
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,280
me to switch to my shop.

35
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,570
Tim Page today slash route and the other way around.

36
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,740
So here I will.

37
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:02,010
First of all add a header and in that header I'll add a math bar and then that nav bar I'll add on or

38
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,640
a list with list items which are links where I go to slash.

39
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,690
So this is just my shop.

40
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:17,320
And then another list item at product which will be slash at product.

41
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,390
This is the page we're on here but I always want to show both options.

42
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,490
Obviously you can write VHDL code that fits your needs.

43
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,600
So this is the header.

44
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,540
It will be pretty unstored for now.

45
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,270
We'll add styling too.

46
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,650
And now let's add a main section too.

47
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,800
So this is also a normal HVM element which holds or which should hold the content of our page here and

48
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,070
there.

49
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,800
I want to have my form with the action that is also adds product.

50
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:56,060
Remember here we're done targeting does post route and in there or there I will add my post method and

51
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:07,120
I will now also add my input here the input type text with a name of title and I will add my button

52
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:15,190
of type submit to your Which I'll label add product.

53
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,940
Now we will add more to this for and later because a product is obviously not just made up of a title

54
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,950
but for now this will do.

55
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,400
We got our form in here.

56
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,720
Let's now copy that entire HDMI Tim Allen code and paste it into the shop.

57
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,080
A team will fall.

58
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,520
And then of course in the main section I don't want to have a form.

59
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:41,410
Instead each one tech my products and below that later in the course we will render all the products.

60
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,540
So here we will have a list of all the products.

61
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,020
Right now we don't have that but we'll get there.

62
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,060
Once we learn how to manage data on the server and so on.

63
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,940
Now the rest of the page can stay the same for both pages.

64
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,760
And again as I mentioned styling is missing.

65
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:05,470
Let's now move onto the next lecture where the goal will be to serve as age HTML pages before we then

66
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,640
work on the styling.
