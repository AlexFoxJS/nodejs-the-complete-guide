1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:09,250
Before we work on the styling let me add one note on how we navigated to the root folder in shop G-S

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,540
and adventurous.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:17,200
For one you could just use dot dot here instead of dot dot slash and this would be preferable.

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,890
Even though both should work on Windows and Mac because now we make no assumption about D separator

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,180
we're using when constructing a path.

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:33,030
So with this if I go back and I now go to just admen at product here it still works.

7
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,340
But now we get a cleaner way of doing this.

8
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,950
But there is even nicer way we could implement this.

9
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:45,490
We could also get the parent directory with the help of a little helper function.

10
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,070
For this I'll create a new folder here helper's or utile.

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,410
I'll go with you till you can name it however you want.

12
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,920
And there I'll add my Poth dot J.S. fall.

13
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,770
And it doesn't matter that this clashes with the global module because we'll import it differently.

14
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:08,930
Anyways now there I'll add an export with Module exports and I want to export a little function that

15
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:15,960
helps me construct a path to the parent directory or not a real function instead.

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:24,530
Variable I should say first of all here all import the POF with require lbf as we did it before and

17
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,640
then it will use a different function or not join.

18
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,580
But Durr name their name as you can see in their quick help on the right here returns the directory

19
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,430
name of a path.

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:44,210
So this sounds pretty useful if we use that we just have to find out which directory or which Folley

21
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,870
want to get the directory name.

22
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,080
Well there we can use the global process very well.

23
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,490
That is also a variable that is available in all files.

24
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,700
You don't need to import it.

25
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,260
And there you will have a main monohull property.

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,510
This will refer to the main well module that started your application.

27
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:09,680
So basically to the module we created here an app J.S. and now we can call file name to find out in

28
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,460
which file this module was spun up.

29
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:19,190
So put in other words this gives us the path to the file that is responsible for the fact that our application

30
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:26,110
is running and this file name is what we put into Der. name to get a payoff to that directory.

31
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,000
With this we can import from this file here.

32
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:35,880
I'll add my own import separated from the other ones simply to make it easier to identify and named

33
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,200
this route.

34
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,910
D'oh.

35
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:44,990
The name is totally up to you but it will require this from going up one level into utile and then Poth

36
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,410
and does root directory isn't the end.

37
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,980
What I want to inject here is a root directory is what I'll start with.

38
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,970
And when creating this path.

39
00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:00,680
And now let's try reloading this page here and it still works and it should still work because now we're

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,250
in the end having a pretty neat way of constructing a path to our root directory.

41
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,100
I'll do the same and shop yes.

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:16,480
Import router from the uto folder at the path file in there and replace Durr name dot dot with router

43
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:17,780
again.

44
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:23,600
You could have totally sticked to the old approach but this one is a even cleaner one and one that should

45
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,510
be pretty straightforward to use and that should work on all operating systems and it always gives you

46
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,080
well the path to the root file.

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,480
With that let's move on to the styling.
