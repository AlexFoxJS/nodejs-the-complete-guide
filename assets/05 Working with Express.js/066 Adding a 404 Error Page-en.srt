1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,210
Now one thing we did in the last lectures is we used the Express router and right now we have a set

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:15,500
up where we also have some unhandled routes if we enter some random string here we get this error.

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:22,930
Now typically we would want to see a 4 0 for error page and we can do that back in the fall.

4
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:29,450
We can take advantage of the middle of weares or the way express uses to middleware and funnels the

5
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,290
request for them.

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,630
Remember that the request goes from top to bottom.

7
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:41,310
So if it finds some middleware that handles it it will go in there and then for example year for Slash

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,000
with that get method on the router we would actually.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,370
And here we also get no next call here.

10
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,970
So no other middleware would be executed but if we got no fitting middleware and we don't have one here

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:59,090
then we actually make it all the way to the bottom and eventually we don't handle that request.

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:07,200
So to send a 4 0 for error page we simply have to add catch all made aware at the bottom where we don't

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,560
need a path filter but we could add slash but that's difficult anyways.

14
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,190
And then simply hand the request recoat response next.

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:23,110
Since I use use here this will also handle all HTP methods not just get requests and there.

16
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:29,390
I can then also send some code like Page Not Found.

17
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:37,060
So little dummy h HTML document and maybe we all want to set the 404 status code and you can do that

18
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,940
by changing a number method prior to send and that is the status method.

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,180
And of course you cannot just use that here.

20
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,260
You could have used it here or in the admin Chesed fault too.

21
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,930
So always before sending you can call status to or set header.

22
00:01:54,010 --> 00:02:00,050
You can actually chain all these method calls send just has to be the last one.

23
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,160
So you're calling status to set my status code and number a convenience method added by express Yes

24
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:13,460
and I'll send it to 404 which is the common code for a page was not found with this edit.

25
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:24,230
If I save this and then now reload my dummy POF your I get page not found whereas for at product I still

26
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,180
get that form.

27
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,600
So this is still working.

28
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,340
The rest however changed.
