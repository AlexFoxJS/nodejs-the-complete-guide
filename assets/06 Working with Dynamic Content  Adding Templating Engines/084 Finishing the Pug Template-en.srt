1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:08,450
Let's make sure we do is set this act of class on the right leg depending on which page we are now for

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:16,160
debt I will go to my routes and there since I'm working on the add product to the Aben just fall where

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,910
I do have that at product route this one.

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,440
Now I will return a new field here.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:30,280
The path field and I will set this to admin add product so you can set this to whatever you want it

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,680
doesn't have to match the path this route has just a pattern I like.

7
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:40,690
So now I pass this POV into my view so that the viewer can find out what is the POV for which this was

8
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,680
loaded.

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,230
Now in main layout will get this payoff.

10
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,390
And now I can do something interesting in the main layout here.

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,160
I know that I want to add the active class to does add product.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,340
If the payoff and the payoff now simply is a variable i get passed into the page.

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,000
If the POV simply is this one and that is something we define a Therefore you could pick any path you

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,840
want.

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,840
So now I will add a check here.

16
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,750
Now a class can be added A C is as class as an attribute here too.

17
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,000
You don't have to use that dot notation.

18
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,830
So class is equal to.

19
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:20,020
And now we'll have some javascript code which we can enclose with brackets here and now here I simply

20
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:28,480
check if Poth and pop is simply just what I pass in here so Diski.

21
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:37,310
If Prof is equal to this value and that is why I meant you can use whatever POF you want you are defining

22
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,220
the condition here.

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,260
So if pompe is equal to this then I know that at Productus the page I'm on because only 40 ad product

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,160
route I do set this path.

25
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:54,000
So then if that is the case I want to render active as a class here.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,050
Otherwise an empty string.

27
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,510
So otherwise I basically set no class with this set up.

28
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:06,990
Now if I reload this page you'll see ad product is yellow because now it is marked as active.

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,360
If they go to shop that's not the case but on shop we also don't use the layout yet.

30
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,330
So let's continue.

31
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:20,730
Now for the shop I also want to use the layout so I will go to add product pack copy my code here and

32
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,000
move it all over to shop plug.

33
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,750
Let's keep your original code for now.

34
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,340
Extend the main layout therefore now I do need the product Zia's as follows here.

35
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,340
But I don't need the foreigns So let's remove that from the Stout's block and for the content it will

36
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,020
need main.

37
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,890
But we don't render a form here.

38
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,080
Instead we rendered this if loop so that's Or does if block.

39
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,110
So let's copy that entire code and put it in here.

40
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,960
Make sure indentation is correct and you don't mess this up.

41
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,280
And now we can get rid of all the other code here.

42
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:02,990
Now again for styling off the header we would have a problem if I now reload because it's not marked

43
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:09,230
as active because I need to use that same approach I did for the add product route I pass in an additional

44
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:16,220
key Poff and there I-PASS slash like this or slash shop.

45
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,620
Again you don't have to use the real path that led to this round.

46
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,310
I'll use slash though to keep this matched.

47
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:29,870
And now in May layout I copy my code from down there where I dynamically add does class and add it here

48
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,130
for the shop too.

49
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:36,490
But the part I'm checking for is just slash here and now I do an act of fear.

50
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:44,380
If the POV variable which gets injected into the template matches slash which is only DKs for this route.

51
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,670
So I've saved this I got an error here.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,400
Yeah.

53
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,900
This should not be an equal sign here.

54
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,670
This should be a colon in shop.

55
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,340
Yes.

56
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,690
Because we're creating a javascript object.

57
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,110
And now over reload here this is active.

58
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,530
This is active.

59
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,590
And if we try adding a book this also works.

60
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,050
So this is now working.

61
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,320
Now there is one thing I saw that I forgot and that is the title for the page.

62
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,980
It's always page not found.

63
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,380
And that should of course not be the case.

64
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:21,440
Now you could turn this title into a block which you then set from inside the templates or if you do

65
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,660
add a dynamic output here with hash tag curly braces and give us a name page title maybe.

66
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:35,270
And now you just need to make sure that every render function passes in a page title.

67
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:44,290
So 44 0 for Page 40 at product page and the shop page we have to pass in that page title key.

68
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:52,890
So starting an admin J.S. here we already got page titles so we're fine in shop Chaz here at stock titles.

69
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:59,940
Let's read just two page title to be in line with the Arbre file and with our layout and in the aperture

70
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,680
Yes fall where we have our 4 0 4 route.

71
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,450
I'm not passing anything.

72
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,960
So there let's all send some data into the view and that's all set.

73
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,960
Page Title here.

74
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,800
Page Not Found.

75
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:20,630
If we now go to our page and reload it we see it shop here as a title for ad product we see at product

76
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,110
and if we enter something random Here we see Page Not Found.

77
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,530
So now does this working.

78
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,180
And now we're using Poch.

79
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,600
Now you can do way more with pi and you can combine all these features and do crazy stuff.

80
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,140
I recommend diving into their official box.

81
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,990
If you plan on using that I instead want to show you the alternatives to.

82
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:46,220
Now we learned the basics of how templating engines work and how you can use them to output dynamic

83
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,110
content in your views.
