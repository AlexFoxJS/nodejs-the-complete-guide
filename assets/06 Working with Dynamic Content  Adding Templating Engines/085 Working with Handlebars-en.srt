1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:07,420
Know we had a very close look at Pike as a templating engine but it's only one of three options.

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,290
Now it is was a quite extensive look because I also explained what templating engines are and what their

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,640
core logic is.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,240
It'll be a bit faster 42 overlaying which just for the other two solutions.

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:26,300
Let's continue with handlebars which does not follow such a minimal Tim approach but uses normal Tim

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,040
L mixed with some templating logic.

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,370
So let's use handlebars and Fortius.

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,460
Let's go to aperture.

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,260
Yes.

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,100
And in there we now need to change our view engine.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:45,460
Now we did install express handlebars but this actually is a package that is not auto installed by express.

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:52,340
So instead we manually have to tell express that there is such a Express handlebars engine available.

13
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:58,560
And for this we first of all import it and to find out whether you do need to do this for your favorite

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,680
engine or not you'll simply check their docs because there does this mentioned to express handlebars.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,870
We at Express.

16
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,650
Yes the name is up to you by requiring express handlebars.

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,170
So now it is important.

18
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,320
And now we have to tell express that this exists that this is an engine.

19
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,360
It can use.

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:24,570
We do this by calling app and now there is engine Methot and this registers a new templating engine

21
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:31,610
in case we're using one which is not built in pi was built in kind of express handlebars is not.

22
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:38,530
So to register this we have to define a name for our engine and you can use any name you want though

23
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:44,190
of course you should try to not clash with the built in engines to which you all to find a link at the

24
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,920
end of this Montral by the way handlebars is a name we can use for example.

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,900
So let's give this engine this name and now we just have to tell.

26
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,950
EXPRESS This is just a name.

27
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,700
Now what is the actual tool I should use.

28
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,280
And that is express.

29
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,440
So that object we just import that dead just turns out to be a function we can call and we have to call

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,970
that basically initialises this engine you could say.

31
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:17,730
So this function returns the initialised view engine which we can assign to engine here.

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,810
So Express handlebars gives us this engine and now we have to switch the engine here to handlebars.

33
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,920
And obviously this name here has to match the name you set up here.

34
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,900
It does you're good to go.

35
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,330
Now you're ready to use handlebars in your coat.

36
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,260
Now how do you use it.

37
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,850
No you do create new files for this.

38
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:45,860
And let's start with the 4 4 H.T. male page ultra 4 0 for handle bars page.

39
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,260
Now we have to name it handlebars here.

40
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,830
Asked Is this a default by express handlebars and we find this as an engine name your.

41
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,660
You can also change the name.

42
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:05,820
For example do abs like this and now you're able to use thought abs as an extension so this is how that

43
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,630
works and how you register handlebars as the view engine.

44
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,870
Now with that just let's use it and let's take the four of four HDMI all fall and copy its content into

45
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:23,110
D 4 0 4 HP Saval because handlebars uses normal HD mail with some custom syntax.

46
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,930
Therefore there is no minimal H.M. version as was with Plag.

47
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,810
Now in this file let's remove that act of clause on that link and the navigation because that's still

48
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,880
wrong in that file.

49
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,300
I now want to change that here.

50
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,220
I want you output that title dynamically so that you can see how that works with handlebars.

51
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:50,310
Keep in mind that in APT Yes where we load that for 0 for page we are passing in does data and the way

52
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,550
you pass data into templates doesn't change with the engine.

53
00:03:54,570 --> 00:04:00,720
This is always the same type of flow you pass in an object with key value pairs where the key is and

54
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:07,290
therefore indirectly all of the values are available in the template just the way you use it in a template

55
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,710
differs from engine to engine.

56
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:16,920
And in handlebars we output this value year by adding double curly braces opening and closing and between

57
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:22,660
these we add page title so that key name for which we want to output the value.

58
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:30,240
And with that if we save that and we go back and reload some page which does not exist we should still

59
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,360
get Page Not Found this time handled through handlebars and just as before with Paga if we inspect the

60
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,090
source.

61
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:44,160
We of course see no handlebars code the curly braces was simply replaced with the content that should

62
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,920
be rendered.

63
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,840
So this is how we use handlebars.

64
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,580
And now you we're feeling confident with the help of the official docs where you'll learn how to use

65
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,560
IF statements and loops.

66
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,920
Feel free to go ahead and all that you've placed the ad product pages with the handlebar equivalents

67
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,840
Otherwise we'll of course do that together in the next lecture.
