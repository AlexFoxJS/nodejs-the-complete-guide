1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:08,340
Handlebars does support layouts but it works a bit differently than it did with Poch.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,770
First of all we have to configure something in app G-S where we register our handlebars and then we

3
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,570
have to pass some options.

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,440
Now my ID helps me here if I controls space it shows me which options I can set.

5
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,650
And you can of course explored your official box to learn all about them now what it allows me to do

6
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:33,790
here is it allows you to set up where my layouts live so which folder I can find my layouts.

7
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:40,560
Let's set this year to a string which by default is the layout so you don't need to set this but you

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,710
can set it kind of to reconfirm this but this is redundant.

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,490
You only need to set it if you would store it somewhere else like in Les's or if you had a different

10
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:57,390
default useful or I'll send it today even though that is to default so that you'd see that setting.

11
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,860
Now you can also define a default layout that should be used for all files.

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,040
And here I'll just name it main and that means you will have to have a main or main layout.

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,050
In my case you will have to have a main layout but H.B. as fall in your layouts folder.

14
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,930
So let's add a main layout.

15
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:20,880
HB as fall in the layouts folder and let's set it up similarly to the POC layout and that was of course

16
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:28,680
influenced by you for a for a page let's copy overdye for a for HTL code into the main layout code.

17
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,240
And first of all Peytral found.

18
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:39,640
Of course we want out of this dynamically or we'll output the page title here with the handlebars handlers.

19
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:46,830
Now regarding the styling in Pike we did find a block where we could dynamically add the content that

20
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,700
should be rendered from inside the view that extended this layout.

21
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:58,750
Unfortunately HP doesn't have such a feature so we can't do that we can't define a block here.

22
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:06,800
Instead the only thing we can do there is we can define a placeholder with three curly braces.

23
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,660
Opening a closing so not normal double curly braces but free curly braces and then adding body here.

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,740
And you have to exactly use this placeholder.

25
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,340
This is understood by handlebars and you will then be able to target this in your view that extend the

26
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,610
layout automatically because you just said it as the default layout.

27
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:34,050
However if you have some part like this where you need to add some styling depending on the page you

28
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:40,690
are on you will have to solve this differently in a kind of a similar approach as we solved the act

29
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,000
of class here in public.

30
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,130
You will have to add if statement here.

31
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,810
Your main layout and this is of course a bit of a more cumbersome or complex way though you can do way

32
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,000
more with handlebars.

33
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,190
You could define custom helpers to help you with that.

34
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,660
But this is beyond the scope of this course where I just want to give you a brief introduction.

35
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,900
Let me show you the easiest way of solving this and this is that we add the if block here and we check

36
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:14,750
if product C-s s and if this is the case let's all close the if statement here.

37
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,750
Then I will add a link.

38
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,290
To buy a product C is as follows.

39
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,620
And I will repeat that same logic of course for Florance.

40
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,420
And again as I said this is the easy solution but it will do for now.

41
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,520
So forums here we have forums CSSA.

42
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,290
So this is working now.

43
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,390
Now what regarding the act of class we all want to add that dynamically right.

44
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,910
Well again simply at the class here.

45
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:54,180
And I add my handlebars handlers here and at the if statement to check if act of shop is true.

46
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,090
And this is a variable we'll have to pass into this view.

47
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,040
If that is true then I'll at the act of class.

48
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,420
And of course all the clothes may have statement so he can also write this in line.

49
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,010
That is an important take away.

50
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:13,970
And I'll do the same for the ad product route here where I check if active at Productus truth.

51
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:20,330
Of course we'll have to make sure that these variables are also passed into the view at least when they're

52
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:20,830
needed.

53
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,730
If you don't pass them they're always treated as false.

54
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,910
So you only need to pass them if you want to have them treated as truth.

55
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,340
With that our layout is prepared.

56
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,040
Now let's go back to the shop Chia's fault who starred with that and as I just mentioned we now have

57
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:44,850
to pass in active shop does it is variable or does property we're checking for here in the statement.

58
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,910
And we should set this to true for this route to ensure that for this route the act of Klaas's added.

59
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:56,420
So let's set this to true and therefore in the main layout this will be true and therefore actif will

60
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:01,400
be rendered active that product would be false because we don't pass it at all and therefore this would

61
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,870
not be rendered.

62
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,920
So that is that.

63
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,250
Now of course we also need to make sure that the product C as S gets rendered.

64
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,320
So we need to pass in this to.

65
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,810
So back and shop.

66
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,730
Let's all pass in product C-s essence add this to true.

67
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:20,300
So you can already tell you configure a lot from inside node express when using handlebars and that

68
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,090
is its philosophy.

69
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:29,400
So now with that set up we can go back to lay out have that finished and move over to shop abs.

70
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,870
Notice we'll use to lay out by the fold.

71
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:38,330
You could this abled is by going to the render function for a given page and setting a special layout

72
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,060
key and setting it to false.

73
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:45,770
This is a special key that is understood by handlebars and it would not use the default layout.

74
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,040
Otherwise it will.

75
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,630
So since it will do that by default in shop H.B. as we can get rid of this entire code here.

76
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,020
Occluding the.

77
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:05,700
And just half in this fall what should be injected into our triple curly brace body tag in the main

78
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,310
layout.

79
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:14,040
So here what ever should get entered in displays should be added to shop abs and nothing else.

80
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,520
So if that if we save this and we go to the shop you'll see we get an error and the error is a bit annoying

81
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,220
to be honest with Express Helleborus it's looking for the main layout thought handlebars file.

82
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,600
So it does not take dot HP sir.

83
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:38,140
And for whatever reason you explicitly have to tell handlebars to do that differently you have to go

84
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:45,730
to the options and set the extension name which only applies to the layout and not to all files just

85
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:52,310
as this applies to all files but the layout you have to set the stage here.

86
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:58,030
HP Yes this is really strange but it is how Express handlebars works.

87
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,740
So now we're setting the extension to H.B. apps for layouts too.

88
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:10,360
And now if we reload this page we see our normal shop page and with that we can of course also go to

89
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:17,800
add product here at product HP s remove everything but the part which should be rendered in the place

90
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,940
of our body triple curly brace body tax.

91
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,350
And if we reload something's missing right.

92
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,100
Do you know what went wrong.

93
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:36,150
Well we're missing some styles and the reason for data is that we need the forums and for this however

94
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,630
we need to ensure that foreigns CSSA is set to true.

95
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,040
We will also need product Zia's s by the way so it admin.

96
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:52,920
J.S. we should ensure that when we rendered this route we set forums C-s as to true and product CMS

97
00:07:52,930 --> 00:08:01,400
as this one product CSSA to true and that we also to get that active link in the navigation that we

98
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:11,390
also set active at product to true because active at product is the key we're looking for here.

99
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,270
With that if we save all files and we reload here.

100
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,720
This is looking better.

101
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,370
And now it's all working again with handlebars.

102
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,740
So as you can see handlebars uses a different philosophy.

103
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,400
Definitely something you have to get used to.

104
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:30,800
Therefore your templates are leaner and there is no better or worse way of doing this.

105
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,500
It really is up to you which one you prefer.

106
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,540
Let's now have a look at a third option Ejaz which is my personal favorite.
