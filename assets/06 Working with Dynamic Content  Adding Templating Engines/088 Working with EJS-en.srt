1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:08,660
So now we had a look at POC and at handlebars to possible templating engines you can use and if you

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:14,840
plan on using them definitely dive deeper into their docs not want to show you my favorite templating

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,090
engine will use for the rest of this course and that is Ejay s.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,210
Now each pass is a templating engine which is just like Pac supported out of the box so we don't need

5
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,240
to register the engine as we did it with handlebars.

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,360
We can remove dead.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,820
We can also get rid of that handlebars import.

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,660
And here we just set the engine to Ejay SNL.

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:44,870
Now E.J. asks has a very nice syntax in my opinion and has a nice mixture of DX 10 that functionalities

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,660
of Poch so not regarding the team.

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:53,380
But regarding the javascript code you can use your templates that you can do things like that.

12
00:00:53,390 --> 00:01:01,280
A simple comparison here and shop Plack file this comparison here with the if statement which we couldn't

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,640
do in handlebars.

14
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:08,630
That is again possible with Ejay ass and do this the nice thing I like about it and still it uses normal

15
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,410
time.

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,700
Just like handlebars which I personally always like.

17
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,490
But of course you can follow along in this course with any solution.

18
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:22,510
I will stick to EJA as though an old source code will therefore be provided with that templating engine.

19
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,840
So let's use it then.

20
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,360
And let's start with the good old for 0 4 page again.

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,540
I'll add my 4 0 4 dot EJA ass file and go in there.

22
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,190
Let's start with the HD mail code again and let's copy that into that file here.

23
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,920
So all d for 0 4 h t Moloko.

24
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,610
Let's move it in there.

25
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,260
Get rid of that act of class which still incorrectly stare.

26
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,880
And now we got this set up now.

27
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:55,640
E.J. S. does not support lay outs but we will find a solution to at least have some kind of reusability

28
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,260
of certain building blocks.

29
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,150
But for now let's just create the whole document in that file.

30
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:06,680
So this is now our page and let's start with the Thaila again and let's output that dynamically now

31
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:14,660
in handlebars we use double curly braces in Poch we used hash tag and then single curly braces in each

32
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,160
ear as we use a smaller than sign and then a percentage sign.

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,670
And then if we just want to output a value in the place we're placing this placeholder we add an equal

34
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:31,940
sign right after the percentage sign and then we close this with just a percentage sign and a greater

35
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,780
than sign.

36
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,040
So this is the syntax.

37
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:41,390
And now here we can output the data which our template receives and justice before the method of how

38
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,060
we receive.

39
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,570
That hasn't changed.

40
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,430
So we can still output page title here just as before.

41
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,170
So just to bring this back in memory in Abdoulaye as we're passing in that page title here and therefore

42
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,420
we can reference page title in our template.

43
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,990
So this will still work.

44
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,230
And with that we can already test this.

45
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:07,280
If I now save it as an I reload here I get an error for at product because I've got no Ejay as template

46
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,340
for data yet.

47
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,940
But if I enter anything else which is not found.

48
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,100
We do indeed see our not found page rendered frue.

49
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,390
E.J. S..

50
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,780
So this is now working.

51
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,340
And with that let's move on to add product.

52
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,240
Let's add the at Dasch product.

53
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,190
E.J. s file here and in this file.

54
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,570
Again I'll just copy in my ad product HVM l code here.

55
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,380
I also want to output the title dynamically though.

56
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,740
So again our syntax year which we used just a second ago.

57
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:44,820
Let's output the page title here and then the rest can stay as it is for now.

58
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:51,400
Now the more interesting part is the shop file because there we all need the if statement and the loop.

59
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:57,960
So let's add our shop thought E.J. as file and in that shop thought each case file here.

60
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:06,700
Let's copy in the HVM code we got here for the shop and let's make sure we all take that new image here.

61
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:13,320
Let's copy that from one of the other files then move over to shop SJS and replace that here.

62
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:20,600
And with that now let's remove these comments again so that desists part of our page let's remove that

63
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,970
part up there.

64
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:31,810
And now in this file we can of course again simply output our title equals page title as we did it before.

65
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,250
But the more interesting part are obviously the if statement and or loop.

66
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:44,920
So we want to output this grid here only if we do have some products now and if statement is placed

67
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:51,140
a bit differently then with handlebars we still use are smaller than percentage sign syntax but not

68
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,900
an equal sign because we don't directly output a value here in this place.

69
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,540
Instead you want to end close.

70
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:07,400
We want to wrap a certain block of code and we do this by adding our opening and closing Ejay as tax.

71
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,390
You could say like this.

72
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,210
And now in there and that's the cool thing you can write vanilla Javascript code.

73
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,010
Now we know that we will get in our shop here.

74
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:25,700
We will get a process key which holds our products array and this will be an array and therefore here

75
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,920
what we can do is we can write a normal javascript if statement so normal javascript code and that is

76
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,840
really important.

77
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,670
And simply say Pre-OT's length greater 0.

78
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,880
And if that is the case I want to render dis So there ofter after descript I also closed this important

79
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,720
you simply close the curly brace which you also have to open here at the beginning.

80
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:56,380
So in the end what you do is you write an IF statement as you would write it in a javascript file just

81
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:04,310
that the part inside of that statement is not javascript code but this HTL code and I find this to be

82
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,300
very straightforward and easy to understand.

83
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:13,720
So it is our statement here with the opening curly brace and once we're done we close that curly race.

84
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,520
Now we can of course then also combine this and add a ELSE block here just as we would do it in normal

85
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,860
javascript again and eventually once we're done.

86
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,680
Also close that.

87
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:31,560
And now here we can output our age one tag where we say no products found.

88
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,690
Now that is nice.

89
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:40,080
Let's see the action by saving and by now going to the shop page and indeed we get no products found.

90
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:49,040
If I now do add a product on add product to your first book we do see it here so the statement is working.

91
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,110
Now again of course we want to loop through all the products and output our data and vedette again.

92
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:59,360
We use the same logic as with the if statement we create simply the normal javascript code you would

93
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,210
use for looping and there are multiple ways of doing it.

94
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,370
We could use broths for each to use this for each function.

95
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,780
Vanilla javascript supports or we use an all for loop.

96
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:20,970
We could say for let product of froths and then we simply open a curly brace wrap all the content that

97
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:27,480
should be repeated and once we're done we add over HHS Tech where we close that trollied brace again

98
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:33,660
using normal javascript and then we have our product in there and now we can again output it as before

99
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:42,000
with this E.J. as equal syntax as I like to call it here basically does inline output syntax.

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,150
And now of that if I reload this page here with the object object that is my mistake.

101
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,800
Obviously we want to access product title because product indeed is an object.

102
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,350
So now we see the title does is Eja.

103
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:01,620
And I prefer disinfects because I like having that flexibility of being able to write some javascript

104
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:07,500
code in the template whilst having a clean syntax that nicely mixes with HCM.

105
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:13,380
Because I personally like using HDMI L instead of the minimal werfen pack offers us.

106
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,840
But as I mentioned you can go with any approach you like.
