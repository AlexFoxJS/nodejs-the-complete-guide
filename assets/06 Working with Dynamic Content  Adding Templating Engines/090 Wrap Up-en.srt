1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,060
So it's time for a quick summary and clean up.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,470
First of all let's clean up since we're using E.J. s now.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,710
We don't need to layouts folder because we only use that for pack and handlebars.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,800
So let's delete layouts here.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,410
We also can delete all HP as HVM L and pack files here because we don't need either of those.

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,030
We just use T.J. as files.

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,510
Now let's delete all these faults.

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:31,190
Now does this much cleaner and not just one to make sure that you really understood the flow of how

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,420
data flows into the templates and what the templating engines do.

10
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:43,100
We do render a template with a special render method provided by express choice that render method will

11
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:50,210
always look for the register engine something we do here at the beginning in app yes we do register

12
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,290
our JSF view engineers.

13
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:59,420
In this case by setting this special duty engine configuration reserved configuration key which is understood

14
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,870
by express to us.

15
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,800
We also tell express chase where our views are to be found though dad actually would be the default

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,900
setting here by the way.

17
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,890
So you don't need to add this if you do use the views folder with that express.

18
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,550
Yes.

19
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:21,710
Will code render we'll take our templating engine which we still have to install separately as a NPM

20
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,220
package.

21
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,160
Keep that in mind.

22
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:31,730
We did install Aegeus as we did install pike and handlebars and then you always just refer to the name

23
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,670
of your view like we do here at product Aegis.

24
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,790
By the way if that were it in a subfolder like products it would simply refer to it like this.

25
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:47,920
But then you just referred to that view without adding the file extension and you can also define an

26
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:55,240
object which will hold the data that is passed as variables into that template.

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,940
So not the entire object is passed in there as you learned but instead you will have a page Thaila variable

28
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,990
a way label in the template.

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,810
You'll have a path variable away label in the template and so on.

30
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,090
And this is why we can use something like this year dessous now syntax.

31
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,150
Understood by the specific templating engine we're using Ejay s in this case.

32
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,480
It simply detects these tax year and then it simply looks for a variable named page title and tries

33
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,060
to output its value well and finds the page title.

34
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:36,370
Because we do set a page title property here and we got more features than just outputting values.

35
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:42,480
As you can see in the shop Ejaz file we can also use if statements or for loops and you'll learn the

36
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,630
different words of this for the different engines in this module.

37
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,870
So this is how to templating engines work what they do and why you use them.

38
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:58,470
And it's important to keep in mind that in the end if you inspect the source code you always just get

39
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,550
back inaudible.

40
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:05,820
Tim Allen code you don't find any Ejay as code in here or any javascript code.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,300
Does this just HDMI all the code that is generated on the fly but also on the server does is not code

42
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,680
that would be generated in the browser.

43
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:24,630
It's generated on a server on the Mont. for a request forgetting and templating engines all to do some

44
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:32,040
advanced stuff like caching some built templates for you if the data input didn't change so that they

45
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:38,340
can return the template even faster and don't have to rebuild it for every request even if the data

46
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,120
didn't change but that some behind the scenes stuff.

47
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,420
For you it's important to understand the general flow.
