1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:09,940
You probably do notice that we do repeat a base structure in all our files here and that of course is

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,450
a bit annoying that we manually have to do that.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:19,510
For example this base set up and all of the import of main C S S as well as the header is part of every

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:27,460
single page and therefore it's a bit cumbersome if we manually have to repeat this set up where to import

5
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,500
all the time.

6
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,180
So what can we do regarding that.

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:38,560
We can create a so-called layout for it is all true then you subfolder in views which are name layouts.

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,080
In case you might have multiple ones and I'll add a main layout.

9
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,670
Poch file.

10
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:50,420
Now I'll take my ADD where my shop Poch fall or maybe 4 or 4 which is the most minimal one and copy

11
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,810
that file content into main layout.

12
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:59,810
Now of course we get some elements here which are dynamic now which depend on the page and want to use.

13
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,210
And the question is how can we reuse this skeleton anyways.

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:11,930
Well we can extend this layout from inside our Obert POC views and we can actually to find some placeholders

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,620
some hooks in this layout where you can then enter their content.

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,330
For example here in the links we get a base layout which looks like this.

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,670
But in over the use that should extend this layout.

18
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,820
They Majdi was disallowed and add more leagues in this place.

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,090
We can find such a hook by adding the block keyword which POC understands and then defining any name

20
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,730
of our choice styles for example.

21
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,780
Now we will be able to add more styles from inside our files here.

22
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,070
And I will show you how to add this in a second.

23
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,230
I also want to remove that active link here.

24
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:56,630
By the way also for potful because I have no assumption about what's active and it will show you how

25
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,290
to then magically set this in a second too.

26
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,900
Now the content below the header also is dynamic.

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,470
And here I again will reserve a block.

28
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,460
So a hook which will name content and the name again is up to you.

29
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,650
So now we get this basically out with two hooks we can dynamically enter content into from inside our

30
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,580
profiles.

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,300
Now lets start with the 4 0 4 PAC page here there.

32
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:30,960
I will just copy that content that matters to me and remove the entire rest and we can now extend DeLay

33
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:38,140
out by adding d extends keyword which understands and now we just to point at the layout for that.

34
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,730
We have the layouts folder and we want to use the main layout file in there.

35
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,480
We have to add here too.

36
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,590
So now we're telling Pakhtun we want to extend this.

37
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:55,450
And now we just have to tell it what to render in that content and maybe also in that stylus hook we

38
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:01,510
defined for a stouts I don't need any special setting here but for the content block I want to enter

39
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:08,890
my own custom content and I do this by again typing block content but now I extend a layout this will

40
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:15,030
not define a hook but actually allow me to add content in that layout and then indented here.

41
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,320
I define what should be injected into the content block in the layout.

42
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:28,600
So in this place with that if I saved it and I enter some random lbf which doesn't exist I still get

43
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:36,480
page not found but now behind the scenes this actually uses my layout and we can of course do the same

44
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:46,170
on the pages like ad product there let's also for now keep the content so that we can copy and paste

45
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,260
content over into our new layout.

46
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,810
So we extend main layout pointing at the layout file.

47
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:02,160
And here I will add something to the content but also into my Stout's block and we do that by simply

48
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:10,170
typing block Stultz here and then indent did we add what we want to add and these are these two lines

49
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,980
because these are the two style imports which are not part of the default layout.

50
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:22,560
So let's add them here in the styles block and then we have to either block the content block this one

51
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,990
where I want to enter my own content.

52
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:33,400
So for that I will copy the entire part in the main section or the entire main section actually like

53
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:40,880
this carrot and move it over and replace this age one tackier and make sure the intonation is correct.

54
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:49,120
And now we can remove the entire rest here and we should now have a file that does extend our layout

55
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,220
and therefore still looks the way it looked before but now it uses is way more concise approach which

56
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,510
also ensures that if we ever change something to the layout we don't have to change it at all the files

57
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:08,430
but only in that main layout file and the our files since they extended will automatically get it.

58
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,780
So let's say if this let's go to add product and this looks good styling is good.

59
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:21,390
So all these styles are imported as you can see and it looks like before almost We got this act of KLOS

60
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,030
missing we don't see that D at product link as the act of one.

61
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,490
And that makes sense because in the main layout we make no assumption what is active.

62
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,710
So the question is how can we dynamically set this.
