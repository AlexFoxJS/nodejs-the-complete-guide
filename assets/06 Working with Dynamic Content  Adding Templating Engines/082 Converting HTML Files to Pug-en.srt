1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,850
So let's convert all these HTL falls to Poch templates now.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:12,700
And for this I'll start with ADD product and entry to add product dot POC file in the views folder.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,090
Now again I will create a team of five skeleton with the help of Emett here by typing h tim L. selecting

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:18,340
Det.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,390
H HTML 5 template here and hitting tab.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,050
So this already gives us a nice start.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:33,120
Now I'll set the title to add product and now a one word is for him to park and of course he had to

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,840
now to Hatteras something we already got in the shop so we can just copy that here.

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,820
Move it over to add product in the body like this.

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,820
Just make sure that you move the act of class from the first anchor tag to the second one.

11
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,950
Because now this is the active route and of course I also want to add my main section with the foreign

12
00:00:52,980 --> 00:01:02,390
Now I'll again reverse engineer it by copying the main HVM code going in there and next to the header.

13
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,660
I want to add it.

14
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:10,390
Main is now just main the form then is nested in there so let's indent it to form has this class.

15
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:15,570
Let's change this and the form also has attributes.

16
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,980
So let's add them here as a comma separated list in brackets.

17
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,090
Now we can indent div here because that is of course nested in the form.

18
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,390
The div has this class and you learned that a div can also be omitted so you can just have dot and the

19
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:38,870
class to render a div and that in there we have to label the label here has an attribute.

20
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:45,260
So let's add this and it has some text which is separated with the whitespace as you learned.

21
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:52,200
Now we also have put your input of type text so let's add this brackets.

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:01,580
Set here to render some attributes separated with calm us and d id can actually be rendered separately

23
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,200
with the hash tag in front of it.

24
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,470
Again using it as selector.

25
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,190
Something you already solve for the class.

26
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,580
Does all this to see us as selector for does class pack uses DS selectors.

27
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,840
So now you have hash tag title.

28
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,760
Now let's remove the closing tag of the div and let's also add the button it's indented because it's

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,780
part of the forms.

30
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,380
Let's make sure it's in the form.

31
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,640
Let's give that the button class.

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:34,750
Don't forget this and let's add the attribute list to make this a submit button like that and then a

33
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,490
whitespace to separate add product text.

34
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,600
Let's remove the closing tax and that should be it.

35
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,280
Now let's all the render some dynamic content here.

36
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,670
For example at product to your title all again.

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,150
I'll put this dynamically page title for example.

38
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,300
Now we have to make sure that we pass this key into this template and we do render this template in

39
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,380
Edmond J.S. So here where I do will send this file.

40
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,920
I don't Cintas fall.

41
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,080
Instead I now render I render my admen file here.

42
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:15,750
The admin actually got the Edmond the add product part file does automate the then and I pass in an

43
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,050
object which holds the key value pairs.

44
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:23,670
I want to be able to access in the template and there I got my page title key.

45
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,510
So that's key.

46
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,110
I'm trying to access here.

47
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:37,150
I got that and I will assign the title of at product just like debt with that free reload.

48
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,430
This has gone because the server restart it due to our society changes.

49
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,970
Now if you click add product does this VHDL code by the looks of it.

50
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,260
I forgot to add d imports.

51
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:58,240
Yeah I need to of course also import my Stahl's sheets so let's copy the links from a shop plug and

52
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,410
add them here in the header.

53
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,550
That's all the check yet.

54
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,270
Product HTL file.

55
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,870
I also need to import the forums.

56
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,540
Seems as far as you can see.

57
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,970
So let's duplicate this here.

58
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:16,400
Does align at all at this import now knows every restart is required because we just changed the template

59
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,630
and therefore gnomon doesn't restart.

60
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,290
And now the reload does looks much better.

61
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,230
And let's give this a try.

62
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,010
It also still works.

63
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:25,550
So that's it.

64
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,580
Now let's work on you for 0 for a page for this.

65
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:36,360
I'll add 4 0 4 Poch file here and I will again create a normal age of 5 skeleton.

66
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:43,330
I will say Page not found here and I will already copy what you need.

67
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,660
The main C S S fall.

68
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:52,000
I will copy that import your from the product part file does link let's copy it over to the 4 0 4 part

69
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:58,630
files so that we got that and then in the 404 HTML file I get the header and I got Page Not Found.

70
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,190
Well we got the header already and add products.

71
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,170
Let's copy that Hatter here.

72
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:11,130
Move dat into 4 or 4 pack into the body by indenting there and next to the header inside the body.

73
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,150
At age 1 tag whereas a page not found.

74
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,940
And with that we should have it.

75
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,420
Now let's just make sure that this gets rendered and for that we have to go to the aperture last fall

76
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,620
because that is where we have our catch all middleware and there instead of sending a file.

77
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:33,130
I will now also render div 4 0 for file and ASP before it will automatically look in the views folder.

78
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:41,870
Due to our setup and it will look for datt POC files so that if I now enter any random pove which doesn't

79
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,970
exist we indeed get page not found.

80
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,450
So this is now working and is now using pack as a templating engine.

81
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,630
No there are a couple of other nice things that can do that I want to show you.
