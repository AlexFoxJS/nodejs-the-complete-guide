1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:06,930
Now that the core basics about no chase and express chairs are set.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:13,450
It's time that we work more on what the user sees because ultimately we obviously want to build an application

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,400
which delivers some value to our users right now.

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:25,000
Thus far we're always returning static HVM pages and typically does is not what you do in real applications

5
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,480
because you don't just have static H.T. mail code.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,690
Most of the time instead it is pretty common that you have some data managed on your server.

7
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,480
Later we will also do that in the database that you have some data on your server which you want to

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,310
dynamically output in the aged female code you sent back to your users.

9
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,690
An example would be a page with a list of products.

10
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,190
Where do these products of course are coming from your database.

11
00:00:52,270 --> 00:01:00,220
So from your server or for example we already have a very simple form where people can submit a new

12
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,520
product title.

13
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,920
Well right now we're not really doing anything with that in a real application.

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,380
You would obviously want to store that and then kind of return it in some other page where you have

15
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,990
that list of products I already mentioned.

16
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:22,030
So as module we will have a first look at how we can start managing data on a node Express back end

17
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,240
for now without a database.

18
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:30,850
No worries there will be a very extensive module about that data basis in this course so you will learn

19
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,780
how to interact with the database too.

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:40,060
But for now let's just manage data like this and let's focus on something else here on rendering dynamic

21
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,020
for now dummy content in the U.S..

22
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:50,980
So these all pages which we're returning should now become more dynamic and actually contain some content

23
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:57,280
that is dynamically entered into them on the server so that if we had additional data on the server

24
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,740
we would send back a different HTL page with different content.

25
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:10,180
And this will use something called a templating engine and you will learn how such templating engines

26
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,090
there is more than one alternative.

27
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,190
And I will present some alternatives in this module.

28
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,450
You'll learn how they work and how you can use them.

29
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,150
So this is what's in this module.

30
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:27,190
And with that let's dive right into it and let's have a look at how we could manage that data before

31
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,990
we then have a look at how we could output it.
