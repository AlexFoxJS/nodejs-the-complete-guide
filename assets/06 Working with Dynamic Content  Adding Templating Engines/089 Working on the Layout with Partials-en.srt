1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:09,910
Now we added some Ejay as magic or some as templates your one thing that is missing here is delay out

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:18,580
functionality pack or handlebars gave us and indeed Ejaz doesn't have layouts but we can use so-called

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:25,180
Parshall's or includes by the way a feature that Pike and handlebars also know.

4
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:32,170
The idea here is that you have some code blocks which you reuse in different parts of your templates

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,070
and you can therefore just share them across your templates.

6
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,820
So it's a bit like the opposite of a layout.

7
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:46,360
Instead of having one Mostert layout where you put your individual view parts into it you have a couple

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:53,770
of separate shared parts which you can merge into the views you're creating and for it at all create

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,950
a new subfolder in the views folder which I call includes and then name is up to you there.

10
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:07,210
I will treat a couple off shared files or shared code blocks and which code do we share across all our

11
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,000
views.

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,400
Well we certainly share this part here where we have like the beginning of the HTML document including

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:22,920
the title including the main C S S even and then we share the body of each document so we all can outsource

14
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,520
that even though it's not that much code right now.

15
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,960
But that might change if we have a common script that we import everywhere.

16
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:34,150
We also shared the navigation so that are free include files.

17
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,220
I want to create here head E.J. s for the start of the document.

18
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:45,940
And E.J. s and of course you can name these files Harbury want and navigation Ejaz.

19
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,690
And now we'll just go to D for 0 4 Ejaz fall.

20
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,540
Grab the beginning of the page.

21
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:57,500
Everything that is shared kept it out of here and move it into my head Ejaz.

22
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:05,130
Now I just need to import this and this can be imported into the 4 0 4 Ejaz fall by adding our Ejaz

23
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,930
syntax.

24
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:13,230
Now with a minus and you use stat if you want to output unescaped h team l code that by the way means

25
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:20,570
that by default if you have decent X with the equal sign and you would render some variable that holds

26
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,960
a string that holds HVM l code it would not rendered it h tim Alico.

27
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:31,670
But to render it as text to a why it cross-site scripting attacks with the minus you can of Y doesn't

28
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,910
really render D.H. HTML code.

29
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,520
We can do this combined with a keyword offered by each S.

30
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:45,380
The include keyword which allows us to include a certain element into this page and then you close that

31
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,820
with the normal Ejay as tack without the minus.

32
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:54,830
Now here in include you simply add a string which holds the POF two to follow you want to include and

33
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,720
you have to enter this POV as it's seen from the file you're in.

34
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,340
Sort of four or four just fall.

35
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,590
Is in the views folder.

36
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:09,040
So the follow one include isn't a subfolder So we just have includes and then had e.g..

37
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,320
Yes and this will now take the H Tim L code in here.

38
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,730
And as I mentioned then also render it here.

39
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:21,720
Let me save that and let's go to some route that doesn't exist.

40
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,590
And we still have a valid document here as we can prove if we open the page source.

41
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,510
So this all works.

42
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,650
Now we're using an include by the way if you use an equal sign here.

43
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,140
You see now it gets rendered as text and that is what I meant.

44
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,800
Does is escaping devalues.

45
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,200
So it's not rendering it.

46
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,660
So if you had some script tag or anything fishy in there it would not render it.

47
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,340
It would just displayed as text and therefore protect you.

48
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:55,490
But if you know what you're doing like we do here because we wrote the code we're including we can and

49
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,070
we should of course include it as age to him.

50
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:03,490
So this is now using a include and we can also use it for navigation.

51
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:09,890
So let's take all that navigation code here put it into the navigation Ejay as file and in there will

52
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,670
also have to manage the active link again.

53
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,960
I'll come back to that in a second.

54
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:22,850
For now let's just go back to four for each case and here again I will just include includes navigation

55
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:28,910
SJS and close that and last at least the end of the document is all the shared even though it's very

56
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,580
short.

57
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:35,720
Let's move that closing bawdy and H.T. mail tag into end each as and let's share this too.

58
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:43,770
So here at the very end I will have include includes and UJA ass like this.

59
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:50,150
Now with all that out of the way I can still load this page just fine and it works.

60
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,980
Now let's also implement this and this is of course a great practice for you too.

61
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,850
So feel free to pause the video.

62
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,860
Let's also implement this for the other two templates we have.

63
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,060
Where are you as successful.

64
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,970
Let's try it for at product Ejaz dare.

65
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,270
We also want to take our common code here out.

66
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,330
So the start of the document not the two links which are exclusive to dis page are those of which we

67
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:29,820
really only need there but instead of the other part we can now include our includes folder and there.

68
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,910
E.J. us to bring back that start off the document here and add product.

69
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,750
You obviously need to replace more like the header.

70
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:46,170
So there we also should use include and then go to the includes folder navigation.

71
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,070
Close that and close the tag.

72
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:56,440
And all do the same for the end of the document since we did that before include go to include us.

73
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,750
And then here includes And then there we have.

74
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,510
And each Yes.

75
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,910
So now we get this in there too.

76
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:09,750
But of course one problem we face if we reload this page is that our act of class is gone.

77
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,040
So we need to bring that back and market is navigation item as active.

78
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:20,960
If we are on the product page now for this let's go back to the Edmund Jaspal real quick where we do

79
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:28,040
render this route and there let's remember that we already added this path for pug and we can reuse

80
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,290
that functionality.

81
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:37,070
We can go to our navigation each last fall and then add a class here and there simply output something

82
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,740
rendered for Aegeus.

83
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:45,920
We can do this in line with the equal sign so we don't need to enclose a block of HVM code and simply

84
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,310
check if Poth is equal to.

85
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:55,970
And now the payoff here is slash admen slash at product.

86
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,450
So basically the payoff which we define here and if this is equal I'll use a turn their expression here

87
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,230
which is in line if statement in Javascript.

88
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,890
So here we have the condition and if data is mapped we now do whatever comes after the questionmark.

89
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:19,060
So then I want to render active here and since I'm inside the class text here I will basically just

90
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,910
add the act of Klosters is how you can read this.

91
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,420
Always keep in mind that this simply gets replaced with text when the template is rendered.

92
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,090
So this will just become class equals active.

93
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:35,450
And then I add the outer condition with a colon and else it's just that a read or nothing.

94
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,350
And now I can copy that here.

95
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,930
That class assignment and do the same for for for ad product where it is shipped belong there where

96
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:49,350
I did it originally I should check for just slash because dad is actually the Poth we set for the shop

97
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,340
here and shop.

98
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,170
Yes dispatch.

99
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:58,380
So now I got this in place I'm checking for two different posture and it rendered the act of class based

100
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,190
on that.

101
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:05,670
And Daylesford if we save all of that and we reload the page we got at product added here.

102
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,490
Now let's go to the shop.

103
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,830
Jay Jay last fall there.

104
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,200
Let's do the same.

105
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,870
Keep d link.

106
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,660
Which we need in that file which is the product C S S fall and replaced the our part with our general

107
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,610
include.

108
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:28,910
So in the includes folder there we have had each as file replace the navigation as we did it before.

109
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:39,610
So there we have include includes navigation SJS and of course all the replays.

110
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,240
The body of the document.

111
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:50,750
So here we have include includes and Ejaz like this.

112
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:56,900
And now with that if we save that to go to the shop page it looks like it did before and we should still

113
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:03,800
be able to use our application as we did before but now we're using includes which is kind of giving

114
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,170
us the same experience as with layouts.

115
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:12,290
We have to repeat all this include code all the time but that is OK and we still benefit from having

116
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,550
shared code.

117
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:19,970
So with that out of the way we got AJ s added and we'll continue to work with that for this course.

118
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:26,450
And I hope you got a solid understanding of why we use templating engines which options you have and

119
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,830
how they roughly differ with that.

120
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,010
You should of course be able to choose your favorite.
