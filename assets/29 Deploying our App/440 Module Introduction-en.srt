1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,830
You did it your belt an amazing no.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:11,640
J.S. application and then this course we actually built a couple of applications and we're typically

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:19,590
not just doing this for our own practice or to do it on our PC only Instead we of course want to deploy

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,930
this application into the web so that it is reachable by our people.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,450
Because as long as it's running on local host only you can reach it.

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,590
And that is the idea during development of course.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,490
Now in the US module will move from development to production and you will learn how we can prepare

8
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,480
our project for deployment.

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,350
There are some things we just want to adjust or where we want to make sure that we don't skip them.

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,190
Well then of course also walk through all the important steps and the configuration you need to do to

11
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,110
deploy your project to a hosting provider.

12
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:03,600
And we'll talk about security because dad obviously is connected to deploying your app because as soon

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,600
as it does not run on your own computer anymore you obviously have to make sure that some things just

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,240
are well secure.

15
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,390
So let's dive into all these things in this module.
