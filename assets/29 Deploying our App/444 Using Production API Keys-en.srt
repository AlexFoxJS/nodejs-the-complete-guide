1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,790
Now I did mention on the slide that you also want to exchange testing keys for production keys and narrowcast

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,780
that would be that Strype key we're using here through environment variables which we do set in the

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,650
Nordman and in the packaged or Jasonville.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:24,000
Now obviously that always depends on which kind of API eyes or third party services you are using maybe

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,840
in your app you use no service at all and therefore this is not an issue for you.

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,900
With Strype what you want to do is you want to click on that to switch to public or to production ready

7
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,420
data.

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,040
Now you need to activate your account here to be able to do that as you see and to activate your account

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,970
you have to fill out some information including some payment information.

10
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,530
And therefore I will not do that here.

11
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,570
But if you were to deploy this into production you need to fill it all out and once you filled it out

12
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:01,740
you will be able to switch that toggle here here at the top end see your life data your production ready

13
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,110
keys and you should use these keys in your code.

14
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,230
So wherever you are using the test Keys right now you would have to replace them with the production

15
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,970
ready keys and data is just a Strype example Abra API.

16
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,630
You might be using might have a similar behavior.
