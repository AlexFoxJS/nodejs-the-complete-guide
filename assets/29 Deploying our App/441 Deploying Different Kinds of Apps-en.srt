1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,480
Now obviously in this course we built a couple of different applications to be precise.

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,250
We built an application with service he had rendered the use and that includes the possibility to return

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:21,660
just HTML pages or as we did is to use a templating engine like Ejay s and obviously we built two API

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,250
eyes.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,410
We built the rest API allograft UL API.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,720
Now how do we deploy these two types of applications.

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,390
One with the use and one without the use.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,640
First of all we have to keep in mind that how the application behaves what it does with incoming requests

9
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,530
and which data it accepts and returns does all our logic.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,590
This is all code we wrote in the end when we look at it from a technical perspective.

11
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,960
In both kinds of applications we start a normal node server and we use a node framework.

12
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:08,280
In this case the most popular one express and therefore these types of applications have the same hosting

13
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,350
requirements.

14
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:16,470
We dont have to make a difference here because in the end when we move our code to a web server then

15
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:23,670
there we also just want to do the exact same thing we did locally will start our node server and wait

16
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,670
for incoming requests and therefore we dont have to differentiate between these kinds of applications.

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:37,240
When it comes to deployment we simply deploy our code start to know its server and we are good to go.
