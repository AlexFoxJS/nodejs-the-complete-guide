1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:08,590
Now with response hetero's added let's make sure we serve optimized assets and for that we can use another

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:09,660
package.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:15,550
If you google for node compression you'll find that expressed serious compression middleware package

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,860
which makes it easy for you to add compression to your application.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,850
It's actually super easy but you can learn all about the configurations you could add if you wanted

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,170
to here in this official documentation.

7
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:33,490
But if you want to add it in a very simple and standardized way you just run NPM install dash dash save

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:42,750
compression like this package is called compression and after you install it you go to your app js file

9
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:51,950
and there just as we imported Helmut will import compression by requiring it here and we then add it

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,650
as a middleware.

11
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:59,630
So let's maybe edit right after Hellmut here by running compression as a function as well.

12
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,850
Now you can configure it as mentioned in the official docs but you can just run it like this.

13
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:10,890
And now for that to see in effect I'll comment this out and save and the notes are there for reloads.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,090
And now I open the network to happen I'll reload my page.

15
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:19,390
Now these are the size of the esus we're downloading especially have a look at main CSSA and Main.

16
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:25,010
J.S. obviously these are not super big but still this is the size of yes it's as we download them by

17
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,650
default.

18
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:33,320
Now I'll comment that back in that extra package and save it and now is very low at that page you will

19
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,620
see that DS as it's got a bit smaller and obviously this will matter more if you have more content assets

20
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,710
in your application that you need to search.

21
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:48,590
So this is compression in action and this is worth considering especially in apps where you have a lot

22
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:54,290
of CSSA and javascript code you are serving to your users or in general where a lot of files are served

23
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,860
to your users by the way.

24
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:01,520
Image files are not compressed here because that actually makes it longer to load them.

25
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,670
But this is a nice addition.

26
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:10,940
I also want to note that again most hosting providers you might want to use have some support of compression

27
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:16,530
built in or might at least offer this compression support which you can conveniently add there.

28
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,250
So then they will compress assets on the fly and you don't have to do it with your own middleware and

29
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,190
then you actually shouldn't do it.

30
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,240
But in case your hosting provider does not support it or you're building your own server then this is

31
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,190
a nice middleware which you can at.
