1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,900
Now we already prepared some things for production.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:13,010
Let me now dive into that secure a header's thing and for will use a third party package which is called

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,810
helmet and you can use it to secure your node express applications.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,320
Now you can dive into the official Box Office package to learn more about it.

5
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:29,840
And in the end what this will do is this package will add certain headers to the responses you sent

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,190
back and it follows best practices for doing so.

7
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:40,280
You'll see which attack patterns or which security issues these are against which it protects you by

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,570
setting the right headers.

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:47,570
So definitely check that out to learn more about these hackers and why it protects you against that

10
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,090
using the package.

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,550
It's very easy though.

12
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:58,640
In your project you just run and install dash dash save helmet and then this will be downloaded and

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,950
you can use it as you see here by simply including it as a middleware and then it will automatically

14
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:09,860
run on all incoming requests and the deferrals will have a chance of adjusting the responses as you

15
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,420
learned.

16
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:19,130
And it will then set its headers so you can simply go to your Apicius file then and there import helmet

17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,050
by requiring it like this.

18
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:29,010
And then as a next step you simply you add this line here ofter you initialized to express app maybe

19
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,000
in the place where Redan also set up all our middleware down there.

20
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,110
Here we can use app use helmet and execute this as a function and this is it.

21
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:48,710
Now with that if I run NPM run start cold and death my new script diad it to use node.

22
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:57,790
Everything runs as before but now actually if I wisit localhost 3000 to your and I hope my network tab

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:05,810
and a reload page I can see that on this response I have a couple of headers being set and there are

24
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:13,400
some special headers which were added by Hellmut here and you can always check that by temporarily commenting

25
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,640
out helmet to automatically restarts and I'm using gnomon.

26
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,430
We had 11 response headers before I now reload this.

27
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,960
We just have 6 because now some special headers are missing.

28
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,570
And that is something you should consider doing.

29
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,770
Read through the official docs to learn all about the headers.

30
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,810
It is adding but it's definitely worth looking at that and probably worth using that.
