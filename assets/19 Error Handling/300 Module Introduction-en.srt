In this module Let's have a look at something you can't avoid errors.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,580
There will be errors in the applications in the web pages you create and some errors can of course be

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,460
a way that by testing your code properly.

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,380
But some arrows are due to happen.

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,910
You will always have some box issues in your code and even if you don't your database server might be

So there will be errors and this module will have a look at different types of errors and how to handle
