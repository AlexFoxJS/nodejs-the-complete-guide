1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,480
I add it does frozen you error in actually yes and to show you what it does let me go to another place

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:08,650
too.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,040
Edmond Chester the controller and change some code there.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:20,310
In there we of course have plenty of code to for example add a product and we do validate user input

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,220
which is also a form of error prevention or error handling.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,870
We do validate that input and admin shapes into a folder there we added all our validation logic.

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,430
Now in Edmond James I'm extracting my logic.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:42,360
Now let me force an error by quickly looking into my database with comp pastie graphical user interface

9
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,870
we used before for interacting with the database.

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,070
And then there in the shop database.

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,910
Let's go to products and let me pick a product idea here.

12
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,210
Now we're creating a new product.

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,910
Will also add underscore ID and it will temporarily import something from the magns package

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:15,590
because I want to create a new object id here and I can use mongoose types object id here pass my object

15
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:22,230
id and at the New keyword and now I will basically create a new product with an ID that already exists

16
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,630
and they offered that should fail.

17
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:29,620
Now let me start my application and let's quickly log in with a user here.

18
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,620
And add a product and here you can enter anything.

19
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,490
Let's look at product here.

20
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,060
And now it will fail.

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,010
You've got this infinitely spinning refresh again.

22
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,630
And if you have a look at your code where at the terminal where you ran NPM start you will see that

23
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:56,170
our server crashed because Mongo Duey fro through an error with a duplicate key problem which makes

24
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,760
sense because we added a product with an existing ID and therefore everything crashed.

25
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,130
Now of course this is a constructed scenario but just because I want to ensure that something goes wrong

26
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,340
at this point because now I want to show you how you could handle such a problem.

27
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,060
Now we are logging that error and I can confirm that does catch.

28
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:26,590
It's called by adding console log an error or a Kurt and I've saved this obviously our notes are restarts.

29
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,630
Let's add a product again or let's try this again.

30
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:35,890
It will fail again of course but if I click add product now and I go back to my code we see an error

31
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,660
occurred here.

32
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,940
So this proves that this catch block gets fired.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,580
But that's great because this means that we now have a chance of handling that error.

34
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,340
Now what we could do here of course is we could return some 500 error page.

35
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,270
We could also redirect the user to any other page or we could render the ad product page again.

36
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,180
We could even keep the old input and that might make sense if we expect this to be a temporary issue.

37
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:08,530
So of course we could take our code from Velie dating copy all that and output it to your nick or use

38
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,520
a tear in the catch block set a status code of 500.

39
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:17,530
Which is a code indicating that a service side issue occurred and then we want to return added product

40
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,570
with at product page title and product in the payoff.

41
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,950
By the way should be fixed up there too.

42
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,700
Minor thing but make sure that the navigation item is selected.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,430
Editing set to False has error.

44
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,140
Beach too true dear a message we can put our own error message here.

45
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,520
Something like database operation failed.

46
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,380
At least try again.

47
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,260
Validation errors can be an empty array.

48
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,320
We don't want to put a red border around anything and we want to keep to user input.

49
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,250
If he saved us and everything restarts let's try to is another time.

50
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,080
So let's add a new product here your

51
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:01,860
like this.

52
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,060
The victory and product indeed.

53
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,260
Now we have a better error handling because now I am returning that same page.

54
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:14,330
I give the user some error message and the user can try again but of course this year will keep on failing

55
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,740
because we have a fundamental problem in the code.

56
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,690
But if that was a temporary network issue this might be a fine way of handling this.

57
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:26,950
Sometimes you got bigger problems though and you don't want to use this solution.

58
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,510
You don't want to return the same page again.

59
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:34,520
Instead you really want to show an error page to show the user something bigger is wrong.

60
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,380
We're working on it but for now you'll probably not be able to continue.

61
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,520
And for such scenarios I'll add a new view next to my 404 file.

62
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,590
I'll add a 500 Ejaz file.

63
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:50,210
We actually already have a view for error handling the 400 page 404 page.

64
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,780
Now I'll add another page that will render error messages for bigger technical issues.

65
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,540
Not for a not found drought's.

66
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:06,630
I'll copy to code from 4 0 4 included in 500 and there I will say some error occurred and there may

67
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,510
be some paragraph were working on fixing this.

68
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,430
Sorry if we're in the can.

69
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,890
Vincenz something like that.

70
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,640
You could add anything you want here.

71
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:26,410
Now we have that 500 Ejay route and that might be something you also want to do in cases where you are

72
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,320
not sure if you will be able to handle this otherwise.

73
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,980
Now to return to his 500 page.

74
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,090
I'll go to my error.

75
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:43,740
As controller and all duplicate my get 400 route and at to get 500 x neither with status code 500 we

76
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:52,870
render to 500 each fall with a page title of error or whatever you want lbf can be slash 500 and is

77
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,860
authenticated.

78
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,410
Yeah we use our session information for that.

79
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,920
Now we have get five hundred.

80
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,270
We just need to add a route for it at now.

81
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:10,930
Let's go to the app J.S. because in their I use get 404 for every page for every middleware that does

82
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,940
not get hndler ahead of time.

83
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:19,060
Now there is one extra Rather they will add with apt get slash 500.

84
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,560
Here I want to use error control or get 500.

85
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,330
So now I define a route like this slash 500.

86
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,110
I now just have to make sure that we do a redirect to that route.

87
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,900
When a 500 occurs and we want to show that page and they offer an Edmonton and the controller in the

88
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,850
catch block I will indeed redirect to slash 500.

89
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:49,410
And now if we save that and a try submitting this again I end up on my 500 error page and this can be

90
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,540
a decent way of handling this for bigger problems.
