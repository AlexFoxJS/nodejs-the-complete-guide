1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:09,340
So we made sure that we listen to requests to just slash nothing and that we return some age HTML code

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,750
with our input field on it.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,930
Now when we click that send button we send a POST request to slash message but we're not doing anything

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,300
with that time to change that.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,290
Let's add another statement here.

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:28,030
And let's check if your L is equal to message and let's add another condition and that condition is

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:34,150
that I want to be sure that we're not handling a GET request but a POST request here.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:45,030
So let's also parse the method from request method and make sure that method is equal to post.

9
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:51,220
Now we'll only enter this if statement if we have a POST request to slash message which happens to be

10
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,100
exactly what we create with this form.

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:03,940
In this case I want to do two things I want to redirect the user back to slash nothing.

12
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,000
So not leave him on slash message.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,360
And I want to create a new file and store it a message to user entered in it.

14
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,630
Now this involves a couple of things.

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,570
Let's start with redirecting and creating that file.

16
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,650
We actually already worked with a file in the first core section.

17
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,410
And do you remember how Dad worked.

18
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:35,590
Feel free to go along on your own if you know that we need another package and not a core module.

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,740
And that was the file system core module.

20
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,650
So let's import it by storing the functionality in a constant.

21
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,930
You can name it however you want.

22
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,360
I'll name it.

23
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,000
F s.

24
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,930
Because the package is named FS but you can also named it differently.

25
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:56,570
This not the package just a constant so f s allows us to work with the file system.

26
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,010
And here I now want to write a new file.

27
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:07,990
So here let's execute it right file and right file takes a to the file and I'll just use the file name

28
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:16,480
to create in the same folder as Apicius and I'll simply name it message dot text and in there I obviously

29
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,190
want to store what the user sent.

30
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,430
Now this is a little bit more work so for now let's just put some dummy text in there and let's redirect

31
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,230
to user.

32
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,220
Important.

33
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:32,080
We should actually use right files sync for now and I'll explain what the difference to right file which

34
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,560
Oulds exists is in a while.

35
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,700
So let's use right files sync for now.

36
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,860
Now right.

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:46,330
Head which basically allows us to write some method information in one go and then we set up status

38
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,430
code of free 102 which stands for redirection.

39
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,960
And then we pass a javascript object with some headers.

40
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,570
We want to set and you could also do this in two steps.

41
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:04,690
By the way you can also set the status code to to 302 and then simply have a set header.

42
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,060
And there we set the location.

43
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,030
This is also a default header except that by the browser.

44
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,440
And we set that location to just slash and it will automatically use to host.

45
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,690
We're already running on.

46
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:23,470
And then we have to call rest and and important ask before returned us so that we don't execute these

47
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,880
lines otherwise we will get an error.

48
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,610
Now let's restart our file here.

49
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:38,100
And make sure to go back to slash nothing and reload that page with the input field and send the value.

50
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,800
And you should simply reload that in the end because you get redirected here but you can see that redirect

51
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:50,670
here in the Network tab of the developer tools here 302 indicates we send a request to message and we

52
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,420
were redirected to localhost.

53
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,300
So this is working.

54
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,840
And we also got the message text with dummy inside of it.

55
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,480
Now let's also get rid of that though.

56
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,880
And let's work on actually parsing the data.

57
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,860
The user sent us and writing data data into that file.
