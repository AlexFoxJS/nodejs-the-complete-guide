1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,770
So let's go back to the request object relocked here.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,100
Now important just to keep that in mind.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:15,840
This request object is the object no chaced generated for us with all the data off the incoming request.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:22,860
When we visited localhost few thousand which we in turn can do because we listened to requests on that

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,220
port.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,830
So this is the request object if we have a look at it.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,080
We see it's a very complex optic.

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,880
There's lots of data in it.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,400
It's not just data.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,930
These are also partly functions we can call and so on.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:43,450
So this is quite a complex object but we all see that for example we have some hetero's here headers

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:51,490
as I mentioned earlier our meta data meta information added to a request and also two responses by way.

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,940
And there we see for example the host this was sent to the request was sent to you.

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,600
We saw Zalm headers attached by the browser.

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,850
Like for example of how the response data should be cached and stuff like that which browser we used

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:13,320
for data request which kind of response we would accept that we accept some age Tim L A SML and so on

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,770
that we would accept and coded responses so where the response is actually many fights to well save

18
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,780
bandwidth and so on.

19
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,450
Gerald It was a cookie attached.

20
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,520
Even we have learned about cookies yet we will sell later.

21
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:35,580
But this was attached some Google Analytics cookie we saw which HTP question was you asked and so on.

22
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:41,250
So there's a lot we can gain from that request but a bit too much.

23
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,010
Now there are only a few important fields you typically need.

24
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,300
The first important or interesting field is you are.

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,540
Let's output debt and let's all the output you can output more than one value by separating them with

26
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,430
Comus request Methot and all the request headers here.

27
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,590
That's output.

28
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,090
Free values and restart the server with node actually.

29
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:14,180
So now it's again listening and let's reload that page on localhost three thousand.

30
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,700
We do so now we see the output has changed.

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,730
We still have all the headers stuff because we're outputting request headers but prior to that we output

32
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,950
the method which you see here it's get and two-CD you are ill and you are elist justice slash here because

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,790
you are l.

34
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,500
It's basically everything ofter our host and we just have localhost.

35
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,080
Well nothing.

36
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,400
And that basically translates to local host slash.

37
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:51,900
If I had slash test now we see a number output and there we see slash test being locked here and then

38
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,900
also get for the method and our headers.

39
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,160
So this is basically how we can access some information about our request.

40
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,620
Now one crucial thing that is missing here is the response.

41
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,160
So let's have a look at sending responses in the next lecture.
