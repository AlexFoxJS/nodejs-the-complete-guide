1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome on of course I'm extremely excited to have you as a student in this course.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,550
This course is all about.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,580
No genius.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,020
One of the most exciting Cirus technologies you can learn these days.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,980
And in this course we'll not just dive into its basics though we will also do that but we'll dive into

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:28,390
exciting topics like handling file uploads page anation working with different databases sequel and

7
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:36,040
no sequel databases for example building an app where we render the use dynamic H-2 mail on the server

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:43,720
and building restful and even graph Q L API is working with real time data and web sockets and much

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,660
much more as you will see in the outline which will come later in this module.

10
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:54,040
There is a lot of content in this course and it definitely is no short course but it will take you from

11
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,630
Ciro to advanced.

12
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:01,750
No JS developer and by the end of this course you will have all the knowledge you need to dive deeper

13
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,860
into advanced topics and start building your own.

14
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:10,030
No child has projects and applications of course and will not just learn all of that.

15
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,580
In theory we will build real projects in this course.

16
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:19,120
We will build an entire online shop including checkout and payment with Dr. J.S..

17
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,680
So there's a lot of content to cover and I'm really excited to dive into it together with you.

18
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,930
Now who am I.

19
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:31,810
My name is Max Schwartz Molla and I'm a freelance web developer as well as five star rated instructors

20
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,110
here on you and me.

21
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:38,850
I got multiple best selling courses and no chess is a topic that was missing thus far.

22
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,080
Well it isn't anymore and I had a lot of fun creating this course.

23
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,480
I hope you have equally much fun and you'll learn a lot.

24
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:52,110
Was going through the course so let's dive in and let's start with the most important question.

25
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,470
What is no chess.
