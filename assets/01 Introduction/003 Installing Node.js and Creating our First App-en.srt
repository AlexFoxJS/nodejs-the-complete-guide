1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,940
So we want to use no.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,180
And the first important step is that we install it and for that you have to visit.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,260
No yes.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,820
Dot Orrick there you'll find an installer.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:20,180
In my case here it picked the rifle for my operating system Mac OS but you will also find a Word for

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:20,740
Windows.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:27,260
If you're wisit doing this page on Windows or you manually choose a different word and you can of course

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,520
follow along no matter which operating system you're using.

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:36,710
The code you write and two steps you need to take to install no Cheras are exactly the same.

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:43,850
You simply download the latest word in here and you then simply save it anywhere and run the installer.

11
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:49,310
This gives you now simply follow through all the steps which are mentioned in the installer except the

12
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,900
license agreement and so on.

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,850
So simply click through that.

14
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,760
Install it on your machine.

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,870
And once it is completed you already got everything you will need to ride.

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,290
No.

17
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,010
Yes code.

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,340
So this is super fast it's done here.

19
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,730
You can close this now.

20
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,400
And now how do we use no chance.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,390
Well the easiest way of using it is to open up your local terminal or on windows power shell or the

22
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:24,680
command prompt in its terminal as a first step simply run node Dasch the like this.

23
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,390
This should show you the worship of no chance you installed.

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:36,600
Now with that being executed you can now use note just like death to enter a special input mode.

25
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,710
The so called REPL will come back to that where you can execute code and have it parsed by node on the

26
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,330
fly.

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,400
You can use this as a calculator simply type 2 plus two to see the result.

28
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,510
Or you can write whole javascript programs there.

29
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,790
Now I won't do that.

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,710
So you can Quintard with control.

31
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,810
And instead let's write a real script which we can execute with no choice so that we can all see what

32
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:08,060
we can do with it for that create a new folder anywhere on your computer and open that folder in your

33
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,730
favorite ID or a code editor.

34
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,480
Now here I am using Visual Studio code.

35
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,660
You can find that on code that Visual Studio dot com.

36
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,630
This is a great idea which I strongly recommend using.

37
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,640
It's FREE.

38
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,670
It is really belled for you such with javascript code.

39
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,590
It will work great and you can simply download it from this page.

40
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,840
As I said for free simply walk from the installer.

41
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,410
It's all the way Lebel for Windows and so on.

42
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,480
Walk for the installer it gives you.

43
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,060
And then once it's installed.

44
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,110
Simply start it and opened that new folder you create it somewhere on your computer.

45
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,970
This will be your project folder for this very first quake app or script.

46
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,720
We're going to right now your Visual Studio code might look a bit different.

47
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,950
I'm in fullscreen mode which is why you don't see any menu items here at the top.

48
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,860
And I also got two important things installed here.

49
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:08,660
The first one is the theme and you can hit command shift P or control shift P on Windows to go to that

50
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:16,520
quick command interface here and there if you type theme then you can go to the preferences color and

51
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,240
choose which theme you want to use and I'm using the dark plus Feme here.

52
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,470
So if you want to get the exact same coloring you can choose that.

53
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,950
And I also installed an extension.

54
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:34,550
You can view the extension menu by going to view extensions or if you have on the left a menu you can

55
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:40,240
also click on the X Chens extensions tap there but you extensions will do or the shortcut you see there.

56
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:47,850
And there I installed the material I theme this theme here I already got that installed.

57
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,400
And this gives me some special fall Aikins and so on.

58
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,180
You don't need that.

59
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:56,030
You just can use it if you want to the exact same layout and thereafter you can go back to the view

60
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,250
Explorer here.

61
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,330
Now this is then my set up I get a good ignore file here since I'll use GET FOR WORD management.

62
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,290
You don't need that.

63
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,660
And with that let's simply create a new file here with control and command and or by clicking that I

64
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,010
can here and then simply give it any name you want like.

65
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:20,790
First app dot J.S. dot JSC is of course important because we're creating a javascript app here now in

66
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,060
there.

67
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,450
We can run any code.

68
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,320
No Chase is capable of executing.

69
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,700
And for this I will write a simple script.

70
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,850
I will simply write console law.

71
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,770
Hello from node genius.

72
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,690
Now you could write this in the browser to the browser would be capable of running this and it would

73
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,640
lock does indeed javascript console in your browser dev tools.

74
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,840
Now you can also execute does with no Acharyas though for this.

75
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:53,550
Go back to your terminal or command prompt and make sure you navigate into that new folder you created

76
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,770
with the help of CD and so on.

77
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,190
You can alternatively also go back to your code and there under the.

78
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:07,800
You can open that terminal and it will give you your default system terminal already navigated into

79
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,540
that folder.

80
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,400
So that's a bit more convenient.

81
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,700
And then here you can run.

82
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,320
Note.

83
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,650
And now.

84
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,340
First dash app dot.

85
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,670
J.S. so that filename if you now would enter.

86
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:25,200
You should see Hello from though jazzier because this executes your code and this already shows you

87
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,310
that node is javascript on your computer.

88
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,820
This is not using a browser it's just using the internal engine.

89
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:40,050
The extended internal javascript engine used by the browser to execute your code locally totally outside

90
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,280
of the browser.

91
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,230
And of course we can all do more than just logging something.

92
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,080
Let's for example write this text to a file.

93
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:53,830
For this we can import something from the no chase environment.

94
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,000
I mentioned that it would add new features to javascript right.

95
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:03,300
You have to import them and I'll come back to the detail import syntax and which features accessed a

96
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,490
little bit later.

97
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:10,350
For now just follow along to this first quick demo and create a new constant.

98
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,860
Also give you a brief refresher about concepts and Javascript in this course and then type require.

99
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:25,800
F s f s stands for file system and disinfects simply imports some file system functionalities into Does

100
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:34,490
javascript file so that we can use these functionality Stehr we can now use F as right file sync here

101
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:42,420
to create a new file and this takes a couple of arguments and the first argument is the puff where you

102
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,990
want to store that file and that also includes the file name.

103
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,080
Now I want to created in that same folder so I will simply name it.

104
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,410
Hello dot text for example.

105
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,540
And the second argument is the data we want to put in there and there we'll just put Hello from node.

106
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:05,780
J.S. with this if we now save this and we re execute this with node first apt J s.

107
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,670
You should have a hello txt file here and this gives you the text written in there.

108
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,900
And this is something you couldn't do in the browser because it's there.

109
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:20,630
You can't access your local file system and obviously it's features like this which you need to dentals

110
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,540
also create a server which we don't have at this point.

111
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,940
By the way this is not a web site obviously is just some utility script and this is something we can

112
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,510
do with no chips.

113
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,520
Well does a first quick demo will learn all the cool features and how this works and what exactly does

114
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,680
send Texas for over the course of course.
