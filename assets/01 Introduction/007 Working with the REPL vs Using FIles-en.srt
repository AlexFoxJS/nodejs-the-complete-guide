Number four we finally dive into the javascript refresher or optional in case you skip that into the

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,010
notorious basics.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:17,180
Let me dive into two different ways of executing your note code one way of executing it which I briefly

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:25,700
mentioned earlier in this module is the REPL replow stands for read reading user input evil evaluating

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:35,390
user input friend outputting a result and L loop for returning and waiting for a new input and the REPL

6
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,380
is what you use.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:43,040
If you just type node into your terminal here I am in the terminal or on Windows to this what your command

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,950
prompt and then if you just type a node with node installed you are now in the REPL which you can identify

9
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:54,350
by the fact that you now don't have that full pop your computer name at the beginning but just dead

10
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,340
greater than sign.

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:05,090
And there you can execute node commands like console lock 2 plus 2 or also writing interacting with

12
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:05,750
files.

13
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:12,860
You can import a file system there just as we did it previously in our file and then we can use that

14
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,760
to write a file synchronously and so on.

15
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,340
So that will all work here.

16
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,870
And this is of course an environment where we don't store our code and files.

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,890
But you write our note application with every line.

18
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,150
The lines don't work independent from each other.

19
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,730
So I can now use the filesystem package for example.

20
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:39,710
Now that I imported one line earlier but once I quit out of this Prose's with control c I'm done.

21
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,090
Does this not saved anywhere.

22
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,950
Does this not a file I can execute again and therefore is a great playground.

23
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:51,470
The alternative to running code is that you execute files as we did it before and as you will basically

24
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,250
do it for the rest of the Course.

25
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,900
This is the alternative to using the REPL when you execute files.

26
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:02,750
The advantage of course is and that is why we use it for real apps that we write our code in advance

27
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:08,930
and we can always execute it and when we build a real app we want to save our code of course in files

28
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:14,120
which we can then deploy in the end which we could share with our developers and where we can also pause

29
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,840
our work and pick up later.

30
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:22,060
And we never lose to code we write but the REPL is a great playground because we can use it to run some

31
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:27,660
commands to try out certain things because we execute code as we write it and therefore these are the

32
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,650
two ways of running your node code.

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,390
Obviously we'll go with the store code and files approach and discourse.

34
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,750
But whenever I say REPL I'm referring to does direct input way which I can recommend for trying out

35
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,710
some features but not for writing real applications.

36
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,510
That is not what you would do.

37
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,430
I just wanted to get these two ways out of the way.

38
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,270
We'll focus on the left one here and with that let's dive into writing some code with the next Martial's.
