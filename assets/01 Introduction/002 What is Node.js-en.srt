1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,100
So let's dive into the most important question what is what.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,600
J.S. No James is a javascript runtime.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,230
And now what does this mean.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:20,960
You know javascript it's programming language you typically use in the browser to manipulate your dom

5
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,620
to manipulate the page which was loaded in the browser.

6
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:31,520
For example to open a pop up a modal or add any kinds of effects because Javascript is a language that

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,370
runs in the browser that allows you to interact with the page after it was loaded and if there is a

8
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,620
crucial part when it comes to building interactive user interfaces in the browser.

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:48,410
So whatever your users see however javascript is not limited to that.

10
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:56,930
No chess is a different word of javascript you could say it is basically built on Javascript it adds

11
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:02,300
some features to it is not capable of doing some things you can do with javascript in the browser.

12
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,490
So it basically takes javascript and puts it into a different environment.

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,280
It allows you to run javascript code on the server.

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,770
You could say in theory not just on the server but on any machine.

15
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,860
So it basically allows you to run javascript not just in the browser but anywhere else like a normal

16
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:28,460
programming language like normal programs on your computer or some computer in the Internet effectively

17
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:34,760
making it a great choice for building web applications that run on servers which are just computers

18
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,850
running somewhere in the Internet.

19
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:44,600
So in detail this means that we can use no chance to run javascript outside of the browser.

20
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,340
That is the core takeaway.

21
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,660
Now how does this work.

22
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:57,500
Technically Well no yes uses We ate and we ate simply the name of the javascript engine built by Google

23
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,880
dead runs javascript in the browser.

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,860
So back to the browser we now are we simply to name the creator SKAIFE engine.

25
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,010
And what does an engine mean.

26
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:15,650
Well it simply means that engine takes javascript code the code running in your browser then or in notes

27
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,380
case which builds up on it.

28
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:23,790
Also do you know just javascript code it takes that javascript code and compiles it to machine code.

29
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,590
And this is what your browser does to what it does in your browser.

30
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:35,390
It does take your javascript code and compile to machine code because dad is to code that runs ultimately

31
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,670
on your computer.

32
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,170
And that can be handled efficiently.

33
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:45,920
Now this is done by the eight the eight itself is written in C++ but that doesn't really matter too

34
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,670
much for you.

35
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,440
You don't need to write any C++ code to use javascript or no.

36
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,190
Yes but no.

37
00:02:52,250 --> 00:03:00,110
Yes basically takes that reate codebase which is written in C++ and adds certain features like for example

38
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,450
working with your local file system opening files reading files deleting files.

39
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,750
These are all things which are not possible in the browser.

40
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,050
You can't access your local filesystem in the browser for security reasons so it does not support it.

41
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,590
No chase adds these features to the eight's engine you could say.

42
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,730
So as you can suddenly do that now.

43
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,210
No Chase does not run in the browser so these restrictions still apply.

44
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,120
They are YOU use vanilla.

45
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,940
We ate so we ate only without the know as extensions.

46
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:37,820
But if you don't install no chips you can use it to basically use that extended V-A to work.

47
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:45,560
To run javascript scripts on your computer which then subtly can access these new features because they

48
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,620
don't run in the browser but are directly executed through that no chance runtime you could say.

49
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,340
So does this how that works to Gavron what no chaced does it allows you to run javascript on your computer

50
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:05,300
and it adds useful functionalities to the javascript engine so that you can do more useful stuff there

51
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,660
than you can do with browser side javascript.

52
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,750
Now one important note may be out on this point.

53
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,520
Also is that of course some features are also taken away in the browser you use javascript to interact

54
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,240
with the document object model.

55
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,060
So if t h t m l elements on your page.

56
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:27,260
If you just execute a javascript file directly you of course have no attached page and they for these

57
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,770
features are missing but this is a lot of theory.

58
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:37,550
Why don't we just have a look at this and see how we can install and use notice and what it actually

59
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,450
does for us.

60
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,100
Let's do that in the next lecture.
