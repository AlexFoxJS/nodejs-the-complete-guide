1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,300
Sahnoun and you learn what's inside this course a whole lot.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:11,070
As you can see let me explain to you how you can get the most out of this course because this is really

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,020
important to me.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,340
I want to make sure that you learn a lot.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,360
Now obviously you want to watch the videos.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,400
Now that seems pretty obvious but this is a video on the main course.

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,820
Watch the videos at your speed.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,920
This is really important.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,810
You can use the playback controls here and you want me to fine tune the speed speed me up if I'm going

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,390
to slow reduce the speed a bit if I'm going too fast.

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,290
Also make sure to occasionally jump back to older sections or videos.

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,220
This is our normal process and learning.

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:47,580
Sometimes you need to reiterate concepts you learned before you want to use that on the Mont. nature

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,360
of the course.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:55,510
You don't have to go at the speed I.M. you don't have to go lecture by lecture and then never go back.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:02,430
Use the tools you got here used to course to its fullest potential and use the on the Mont. nature in

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,300
this course.

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,420
We will also build projects and you will find a lot of exercises and assignments.

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,060
I encourage you to do this of course you can all just watch meet code and just watch my solutions to

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,870
the assignments.

21
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,030
But you will learn way more if you try to solve these things on your own.

22
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,600
And if you actually code along now.

23
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:29,920
One important note for this is of course that you want to do that also at your speed and buy.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,020
Well of course all of following along the videos but also make sure to Google for problems if you hit

25
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,610
any.

26
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,770
Not because I don't want to help you I will help you if you need help but because this makes you a better

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,060
learner you need to be able to solve your problems on your own.

28
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:55,380
And I see too many students who have to ask first research later mentality and this is not really that

29
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,090
great for you.

30
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,080
This makes me learn it better because I get challenged a lot which is great.

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,050
But you learn more ultimately.

32
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,230
So definitely try to solve your problems on your own.

33
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,330
It will help you a lot.

34
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,480
Also use all the course resources you find in there.

35
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,980
That's not just the videos.

36
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,770
That's also the attached source code which you find attached to the last lecture of each module which

37
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,320
you can use to compared to your code if you're facing any problems.

38
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,740
And again this is a great way of solving problems on your own by comparing the solutions and finding

39
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,750
out what went wrong on your own.

40
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,240
So use all these resources.

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,720
Also make sure to use the additional links I occasionally post and some lectures where you can research

42
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,330
a bit more about certain topics and dive a bit deeper in cases where you're interested in that topic.

43
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,760
Now last but not least this course like all year to me courses has a Q and A section.

44
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,580
You can post questions on that yode.

45
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,770
There is a Q and A button at the bottom of the video or in the course dashboard d general Q and A section

46
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,360
and you can search there.

47
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:07,210
Make sure to all the search to Q&amp;A before you post often a question has already been answered.

48
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,850
But you can also post there if you got a question.

49
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,130
Now the thing about asking is asking is easy answering is hard.

50
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,500
So try helping.

51
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,610
Obvious to take this opportunity of answering to questions of other students simply because you again

52
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,050
get challenged.

53
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:32,020
And if you're wrong that doesn't matter you'll be correct then you'll learn again but you will learn

54
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,420
so much by being forced to think about a problem.

55
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,040
Articulate a solution and the best of all.

56
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,100
You also help students so help each other.

57
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:47,500
I will also help you of course but if you do all these things you'll get a lot out of this course promised.

58
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,960
But with that let's leave this first module and continue with the course.
