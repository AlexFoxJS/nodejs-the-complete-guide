1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:10,580
I added note Mailer and now I want to use Noad mailer to send an email or that in my office last fall

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,080
which is the only filer I will interact with it.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,330
I will import no Mailer and stored in constant at the top.

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:25,000
So require node mailer like this and it will also import send grid transport.

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:31,550
You can name these concepts the way you want as always and this will inport node Meilleur centered transport

6
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,770
with that imported.

7
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,680
I can initialise a couple of things here for note Meilleur we need to initialize a so-called transporter

8
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,590
so that is essentially some set up telling node Meilleur how your e-mails will be delivered.

9
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,350
Because as I mentioned Noach J.S. won't do this on its own.

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,730
You need some third party service for that.

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:58,870
So you're able use node Meyler and then call the Create transport method and create transport.

12
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:05,210
We can now pass central to transport and execute this as a function because this function will then

13
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,170
return a configuration that node mailer can use to use Sanskrit.

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:17,990
Now two dead central transport function we pass an object where we pass an off object and this in turn

15
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:25,310
holds an object where we have to pass in the API user and API key field.

16
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,480
Now both our values you get from inside your central account.

17
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:39,110
So if you head back to your center grid account you can click on settings here and then a.p keys and

18
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,250
there create a new API key.

19
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,830
You want to give that a name an all name that node shop the name is totally up to you.

20
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,510
And I'll take full access and create this.

21
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,910
Now take that key and you actually only need that key.

22
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:01,010
You could have used your username and password but I'll just use the API key.

23
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,020
So just dead key which you copied here of course use your own key not mine.

24
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,810
And with that you configured the transporter

25
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:17,650
now with the transporter configured you can now use it to send an e-mail and a one to send an e-mail

26
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,190
or after signing up let's say so in posts sign up once I'm done.

27
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:28,660
So here when all's redirect back to the logon page here I want to send my message.

28
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,510
And I used to transport her for dead.

29
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,860
And then there is a send mail method we can execute to that method.

30
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,800
You pass a javascript object where you can figure the email you want to send.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,740
For example the two fields so to whom this should go.

32
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:51,000
While this should go to our e-mail address of course from so which e-mail address will be displayed

33
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,570
and hearable have shop at Noad complete dot com.

34
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:08,130
Let's say then a subject sign up succeed it and then Khumalo content so the content of your message.

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,500
Now you could have a complex HVM l message.

36
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,110
I'll just add H-1 tag here.

37
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,060
You successfully signed up like Det.

38
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:25,040
So it is the message I want to send now send sendmail then gives me a promise so I can use of then and

39
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,580
catch or of course I simply return that and then I redirect in the next and then block so once the email

40
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:37,040
has been sent however to this up to you you could also redirect immediately and not wait for this to

41
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,360
be sent because you're not really relying on that being sent.

42
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,660
And so this will send.

43
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,640
And at the same time you redirect.

44
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:51,530
So whatever you want what you should do though is if that is your plan you might want to switch positions

45
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:59,110
here and still return that so that you can still catch any errors that are stemming from this.

46
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,290
So that here we could still log any errors we might be getting or do something else with these errors

47
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,800
of course with this set up at it.

48
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,990
Let's give it a try.

49
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,780
Let's head over and sign up.

50
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,460
And now you should use a real e-mail address of course.

51
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,880
Otherwise it can't arrive.

52
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,570
Click sign up here.

53
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,210
I am redirected.

54
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,800
And now check your e-mail account.

55
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,460
And in that e-mail account you should have a e-mail from shop at Note complete dot com with that message.

56
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:37,810
If you don't get it verify you entered a correct e-mail and also feel free to verify your send read

57
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,380
e-mail.

58
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,480
You should have gotten an e-mail from the Sanskrit when signing up verifying your e-mail address there.

59
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,780
But with that this should work and you should be able to send e-mails like this.

60
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,780
Now dive into the official send read docs and all the no mail or docs if you want to learn way more

61
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,670
about what you can do there.

62
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:03,250
Also as I mentioned Google for node Meyler and your favorite e-mailing service if you want to use a

63
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,140
different one.

64
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,510
But is this the general theme of how this works.
