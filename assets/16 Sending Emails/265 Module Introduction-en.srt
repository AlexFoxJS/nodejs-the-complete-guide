00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:08,240
In this module I now want to give you an introduction to how you can send e-mails from inside your node

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:15,630
application obviously sending emails is a crucial task in many web applications and on our Web sites.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:22,940
We want to send an e-mail ofter a user signed up for example to confirm did you sign up something like

4
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,870
debt.

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:24,240
That.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,930
I will show you how that works what sending e-mails in a note application actually means and which part

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,170
note J.S. and EXPRESS Has play in that big picture and will then implement that will then implement

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,060
a package that helps us sending e-mails and we'll send the e-mail.

9
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,060
Upon successful sign up.

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,060
