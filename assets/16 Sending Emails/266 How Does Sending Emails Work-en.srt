1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,760
So how does sending mails work.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,680
Well you obviously get our notes server with our code and we get our user and we want to send the email

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,010
to the user.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:19,400
Now it's super important to understand and a common misconception that note and express Yes these are

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:26,210
language languages or frameworks run times that we use for writing our server side logic but with no

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,870
yes you can't trivially create a mailing server handling mails.

7
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,360
It's totally different to handling incoming requests and responses.

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,690
It's a totally different technology something totally different happens behind the scenes.

9
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:48,980
Therefore in reality you will very likely never implement your own mail server because that is a very

10
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,210
complex task.

11
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:56,840
Creating a mail server that is capable of handling that dozens or a one hundred thousands of e-mails

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,290
at the same time sending them and so on security all that stuff is highly complex.

13
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:08,180
So in reality you typically use third party mail service for that and that is exactly what you will

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,310
do in this Marchal too.

15
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,650
But I will show you how to interact with such a service to send that e-mail frood at service.

16
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:21,440
And by the way all major web applications you might be interacting with including you to me don't have

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:28,850
their own mail servers they are using third party providers like A.W. as well whatever it is for sending

18
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,420
e-mails.

19
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,790
So that is exactly what we will do in this module to.
