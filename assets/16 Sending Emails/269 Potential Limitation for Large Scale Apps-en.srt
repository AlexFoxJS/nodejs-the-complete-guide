1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:08,790
So in this module I showed you how to send mails with no Mailer and in this case send a third party

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,760
service.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:17,070
Now one thing I also want to highlight is the way we send that e-mail here works for our app and it's

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,160
good that we don't block the redirect but then we redirect and sent the mail at the same time because

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,770
if you have application with a lot of requests and you would wait for the email to be sent before you

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,430
redirect.

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,160
You might slow down your application because you're sending a lot of e-mails.

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,470
Now depending on the size of your app and now we're talking about really huge apps you could also look

9
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,410
into totally different approaches.

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:49,110
Mary you have some server side scripts running every x hours or every X minutes that send e-mails to

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,750
newly signed up users.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,880
Now this will only matter from a certain scale of app on and there you have different problems anyways.

13
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:03,060
But I just want to highlight that you should strongly consider not using this in a blocking way because

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,720
if you wait for it to be finished this can be slow and you have to evaluate if it's worth waiting for

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,660
days or if your user can continue even without that mail being delivered.

16
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,780
Now with that you learn how to send mails.

17
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,920
Not that difficult as you can tell.

18
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,560
Now let's use that knowledge in the next module and it haunts our often dictation process or our authentication

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,640
features we offer.
