1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:08,220
So for now we got Dad gnomon package installed and it will just work because it automatically installed

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,480
all the dependencies.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,110
This package needs in turn.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,260
So how can we now use it.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:22,630
Node one is a utility tool and it allows us to run our application our node application through this

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,260
package here which will run node apps.

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:33,250
Yes and he in the end but who will also watch our files for changes and restart the process for us if

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,700
we do change something so we can simply change start here.

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,520
So the note I have aperture has command to gnomon app.

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:49,060
Yes and this will look for a node Mawn tool which you will find in this project because we install it

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,690
here as a side note.

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,380
If you were to run node one actually down there you would get an error that this command is not found

13
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:02,590
because its only installed in this project and not globally on your machine but the terminal will try

14
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,020
to find us globally here.

15
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,070
It will work because this will look globally.

16
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:15,460
So if you now run A.P.M. start this will simply start the node server and outputs some extra information

17
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,680
and if you now go to your routes she has fallen out at something.

18
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:25,210
Lets just add an extra line and you save that file you see it's restarting.

19
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:31,660
And this of course is very convenient because now we dont have to spend time on manually exiting and

20
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,540
restarting.

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,630
Now is this done for us.
