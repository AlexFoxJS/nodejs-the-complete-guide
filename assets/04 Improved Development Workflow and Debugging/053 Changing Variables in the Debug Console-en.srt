00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,810
There's one more feature about the Nocenti bagger which I also haven't shown you yet but which of course

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,320
don't want to forget if you start debugging your.

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:18,830
And here I just used the shortcut and you place a breakpoint anywhere in your app and then do something

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,580
to trigger that break point.

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,710
I showed you that you can look into all these variables and that you can look into them in the debug

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:30,620
console without changing them while sometimes you might want to change them.

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:38,560
And that can be done by going to the debug view here and then by simply typing in there.

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:44,280
Now for example the parsed body holds this string and you can't just change it.

9
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:49,330
And now this will affect the runtime as conceived you hover over this.

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:55,040
So now if I just resume execution with my code which doesn't have a back right now and I go back to

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,550
my explorer of view here then you will see that as stored testing here which is de-value I added it

12
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:08,840
in the debugger so you can actually manipulate the values Stehr off the variables and so on if you need

13
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,540
to.

14
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,620
You can do that because this of course allows you to make sure that you can quickly test something.

15
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,730
This is just another useful feature which I wanted to share with you since it can help you with debugging

16
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,700
your code being able to untypically some values there.
