1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,930
Syntax errors can be very annoying.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,190
But most of the time they're not that hard to fix.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:13,330
Let's add a simple syntax error here an app chase let's simply remove d t in concert.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,990
Now all of a sudden this is an invalid keyword.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,050
It doesn't exist it's not a keyword.

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:23,270
And we already get some help in the ID which is showing us something is wrong here.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,010
Now if we hover over this we see that a semi-colon is expected.

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,450
And actually this is not that helpful.

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,020
And this is simply because we to do code things so that this is a variable.

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,470
And since we have a variable in the same line we should close this with a semi-colon.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,550
And now it actually doesn't show an error but let's save this and let's try running our app with end

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,160
start without me call and B get it and you will see it right away.

13
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,110
Crashes and in there we see unexpected identifier Condes server.

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,040
So in the end was it doesn't clearly tell us that we forgot duty here because it's not smart enough

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,120
to understand that this is the error here.

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,930
We still see that the error seems to be stemming from this line.

17
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:14,890
And in such cases as dumb as it sounds you should simply take a closer look at this line and see what

18
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:15,980
could be wrong there.

19
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,270
And you should quickly be able to see.

20
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,780
I've got a t here.

21
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,730
So these are syntax errors.

22
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:29,400
Abra Aeros would be that you maybe go to reroutes shares fall and let's say you forget a closing curly

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,390
Brasier.

24
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,680
Now again we're just to decode Das complainant's does show an error over there.

25
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,590
If we chumped there we see at the end that the closing curly braces are expected.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,130
Now it's not expected at this point where it's showing this message but it's expected somewhere in the

27
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,670
file and once it can be cumbersome.

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,170
You should then check your block statements like this if statement and see if they're all closed correctly

29
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,870
in to do code you also get some help because if you click next to such up call the brace you'll see

30
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:03,860
that this line gets highlighted and that actually shows you where it thinks that this is getting closed.

31
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,570
And this is far too much at the bottom here.

32
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:14,610
For example again if you run this you will see that a trashiest And there you also see unexpected token

33
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,750
and it points us en route.

34
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,170
Yes.

35
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,650
And then you see the line number two.

36
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,370
So here it points us the line 52 and it basically shows us the same place as well suited code which

37
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,600
is the wrong place.

38
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,870
But in such a case here you should really take the ID help see that error message and then go through

39
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,430
your follow and see.

40
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,850
Hmm where could I be missing a character or where do I have an extra closing curly brace or something

41
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,540
like debt.

42
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,090
And eventually you should be able to find this error and Thale for of course fix it.

43
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:53,820
So syntax arrows should always result in the error message and then that can sometimes be hard to find

44
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,490
them.

45
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:02,880
Often it's like a typo a mis typed variable name of a variable that therefore doesn't exist or missing

46
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,190
or extra characterise but you can find them and it just takes some time to go for your fall.
