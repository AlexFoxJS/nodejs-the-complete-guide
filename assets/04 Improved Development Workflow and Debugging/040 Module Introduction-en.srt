00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:08,360
Knouted we already had a pretty close look at no Chason worked a lot with it.

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:14,120
Let's take one step back and let's see how we can both make development a bit easier.

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,960
We can speed that up a little bit and most importantly how we can actually debug our notorious apps

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:28,530
or how we can use various tools to understand better what's going on in our no japes applications.

5
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,290
Because in this module you will learn some tips and tricks which will hopefully help you right.

6
