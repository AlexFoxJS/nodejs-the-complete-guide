1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:08,580
In this course you obviously learn a lot about Noad and how to write code code and build web servers

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,450
or web applications with Knode because there really is its main thing.

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:22,770
But note NPM the package manager we get for free when installing no chase can also be used as a build

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,460
tool.

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:31,650
So as a tool that runs utility scripts on your computer and can help you with building any mostly javascript

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,820
driven project and that does not have to be a web application or a service wide web application if it

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,970
is one it could be a front and web application too.

8
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:49,080
Like do you react as we had in this course the front end for the arrest and the Graph API and in this

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:56,010
module will briefly dive into that and I'll explain why that is to case what exactly NPM is and how

10
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,260
we can use it and how we can use node as a built tool.
