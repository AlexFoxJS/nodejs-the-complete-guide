1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,780
It's important to understand.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:12,180
Dead when we install no yes we get two tools or things for the price of one you could say we get no

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,710
genius and we get NPM notes package manager.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:23,370
And remember that this was the tool we used for installing packages into our project or when I share

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:29,430
my project like with all the code attachments that you could re-install all dependencies required by

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,350
that project.

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:36,300
Even though I did not shared a node modules folder because we have that packaged adjacent fall where

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,520
we see all the dependencies.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,500
So no.

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:46,440
To programming language we used to execute code to execute javascript code based on that note has runtime

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,730
with all the features that gives us and especially important when we look at it from a built tool perspective.

12
00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:00,930
We have to remember that with note J.S. we were able to interact with files and this will become important

13
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,010
in a second.

14
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,160
NPM as I said is node's package manager.

15
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,980
So we manage guess what packages with it and with that I mean we can install packages download them

16
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,690
manage their work chansons on and we can also run scripts.

17
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:22,170
We did that with NPM start for example to start our server so that we don't have to write or type the

18
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,220
full command for that.

19
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,380
Now let's have a closer look at these two pieces and see what else they can do or how that can be helpful

20
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,790
to use them in the context of build tooling so in the context of utilities scripts and not in the context

21
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,290
of spinning up a web server.
