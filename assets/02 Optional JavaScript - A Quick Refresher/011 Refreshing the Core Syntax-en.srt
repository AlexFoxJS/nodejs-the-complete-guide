1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,750
Ford it let's just play around with javascript and I'm in a brand new empty folder which I opened with

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:16,030
my ID do you code and in there altered a new file and I'll name it played out just the name is totally

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,470
up to you though.

4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:22,540
Now let me start with some core language features variables and functions.

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:29,470
And again you should definitely dive into a core javascript resource like the ones I linked into second

6
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,050
lecture off this module.

7
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,790
If you are brand new to Javascript.

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:41,320
So by now do expect you to know what variables functions are also expected to be aware of what if statements

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,750
or loops are.

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,390
These are all core things you got to have set by now because you are crucial for javascript no matter

11
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,880
if you are using it in the browser or on the server.

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,130
So for variables you might know disinfects with the a keyword.

13
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,780
You can have a name in for example store Maxson there right.

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:07,330
This would be a variable and now you can use that for example to simply output it like this.

15
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:13,510
And if we now run this file with no chance by running node played out just as the command we have to

16
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:20,740
write in a terminal navigate it into dead project folders so into that folder where I'm having display

17
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,850
Chia's file then I see Macs down there right.

18
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,700
So that is some Javascript code.

19
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,660
We can also create a number verbal age which now would be a number.

20
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,040
It's not in close to quotation marks so this first one is a so-called string.

21
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,190
Does this number.

22
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:44,060
We can also add a third one has hobbies and that would now be a boolean.

23
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,380
These are some core types.

24
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,580
Javascript knows.

25
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,350
True false are booleans numbers are well numbers.

26
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,340
They can also have decimal places.

27
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,680
These are strings.

28
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:00,540
And now here I can also define a function with the function keyword summerize user.

29
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,000
Does this how you create a function javascript and there we could return something.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,800
Functions can return values with the return statement.

31
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:19,780
They all can get input like user name user age and user has hobby you can name these arguments as these

32
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,530
things here are called.

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,940
However you want.

34
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,510
These are not local variables only available in instead of a function not outside of it.

35
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,680
And then you can return.

36
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:42,870
Name is Plus user name plus let's say some text with a comma a whitespace H is whitespace used are h

37
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:50,870
class and user has hobbies and then user has hobby something like debt.

38
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,610
Now here I am simply returning some text which I manually concatenating by a hardcoded strings and the

39
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,610
dynamic values I'm getting as an argument.

40
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:06,810
Now we can also cancel the result of summerize user we call a function by adding parentheses offered

41
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:07,440
a name.

42
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,610
And now we just have to pass in data we expect here as arguments so we need to pass and free arguments

43
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,640
your the name D.H. and has hobby's sort of free variables.

44
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,980
I'd have find up here we could have directly access them in the function too by the way.

45
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:30,120
We don't have to take the way of accepting arguments but this is a pure function which does not depend

46
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,880
on anything from outside the function but gets all the data it works with as part of the arguments which

47
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,150
is a nice way of writing functions.

48
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,930
And now if I execute this well then we get this output.

49
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,070
Now this is just a summary of the features you should be aware of.

50
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,500
As I mentioned I just want you to know or I just want to be sure that you know how we work with variables

51
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,490
how we would work with functions how we call functions.

52
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,090
And did you understand how parameters or arguments in the function are used in there and only in there.

53
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:08,540
We couldn't use user name outside of therapy because of something called scoping in javascript.

54
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,920
We can then call a function like this and pass in the data.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,110
We could hard code the data here or refer to variables which have to be a way in the scope of this statement

56
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:25,860
which is the case for these variables since they are global variables and these are variables and functions

57
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,050
and how we interact.

58
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,730
And these are some core of features you have to be aware of.

59
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,520
Let's not dive into something more exciting in the next lecture.
