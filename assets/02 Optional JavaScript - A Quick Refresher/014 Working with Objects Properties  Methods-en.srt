1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,290
Know let me get rid of that existing code.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,560
You find a snapshot of the code you wrote thus far attached to the last lecture.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,220
Let me write some new code.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,780
An important thing you work with or important data structure you work with javascript are objects.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,060
You could have something like a personal object and you create an object typically with curly braces.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,270
And then in there you have key value pairs.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:33,110
You to find a key by simply typing well whichever you want to use let's say name.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,500
Then you have a colon and you must have the colon and offered a colon.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,690
You have your value.

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,840
In my case a string max and then with a comma you can add an average key value pair.

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,050
Age 29.

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:55,280
Now this is an object and I can lock person to your if I now execute placates we see that object being

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,490
printed here.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,020
Now objects allow us to group data together.

15
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:06,900
You can also not just have variables in there so to say but you can all have functions in there.

16
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:14,700
For example agreed function and there you can simply have an anonymous arrow function or an arrow function

17
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,390
general as a value after de colon and then in there you could have consul lock.

18
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,200
Hi I am.

19
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,270
And then the name and does would now be accessed with the this keyword instead of an object you have

20
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,020
to use this to.

21
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,240
Typically and there is something special about this which I showed in that video I linked before it

22
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,610
in an earlier lecture.

23
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,340
But typically this refers to the surrounding object.

24
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,050
And now we can use the dot notation.

25
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,870
So Dot two Xs properties or methods.

26
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,630
So variables are functions inside of that object.

27
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,330
So we could now use this name.

28
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:02,280
And now I can use that person and call agreed with the dot notation and executing it as a function.

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,860
So the dot notation is important on this which refers to the object or on you referring to that object

30
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,680
which is stored and is constant here and now of execute to say again I'm saying hey I'm undefined.

31
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,770
Now why is that.

32
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,880
Well the reason for it Ed indeed is what I talked about aero functions.

33
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:30,100
This now here refers to the global scope to the global node runtime scope and not to this object to

34
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,020
have it refer to that.

35
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:40,830
We either have to use the old school function like this now I never repeat that I'm saying Hey Max or

36
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,550
we use a slightly different approach or syntax here in an object.

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,000
And that is you don't use an arrow function but you use grid like Det.

38
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:58,680
So you admit to Colon add the parentheses offered a key name and then without a function key word or

39
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,970
anything like that you add your function body.

40
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,950
And now this is a method of this object.

41
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,770
And you see.

42
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,480
Hi I'm Max 2 now.

43
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,320
So this is something important and does the index you'll see me use for this course without the colon

44
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,340
parentheses right after the key and then the function body.
