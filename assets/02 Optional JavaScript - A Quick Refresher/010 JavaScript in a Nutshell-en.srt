1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,890
So knouted we know for whom this modulus.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,030
Let me summarize javascript briefly.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,230
Javascript is a weekly typed programming language.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,210
It's an object oriented programming language.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,250
It's very we're style.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,770
And what do you mean with that weekly type.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,570
Instead we have no explicit type assignment.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:28,950
Javascript knows types like numbers or text which is called string or booleans which is true or false

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,470
but it doesn't force you to define which type you're using in a variable or in a function.

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,070
And indeed you can also have a variable where you store a number which you then suddenly change to a

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,180
text variable.

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,280
So you can switch types dynamically in overlaying which just does this differently.

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,260
And was this gives you greater flexibility to be able to change it and to not have strict typing.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,060
It also can lead to errors.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,590
So it is just something you have to be aware of.

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:04,110
Object oriented simply means that data can be organized in logical objects and we'll see these objects

17
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,280
in this module.

18
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:12,840
And one important concept here is did you have to be aware about the difference of primitive and reference

19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,380
types and attached to this lecture.

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,360
You'll find a link to an article and video I created for my free YouTube channel had a mind where I

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,350
do dive into primitive and reference types and where I do explain the difference and why they are important.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,780
So definitely check that out if primitive and reference types don't tell you anything regarding the

23
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,720
versatility.

24
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,590
Well we can see that in this course.

25
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,700
Javascript runs in the browser and this is actually where it comes from but you can also use it with

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,870
no chest to run it on your PC.

27
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,030
Outside of a browser set up or on a server.

28
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,740
Therefore And that is exactly what we'll do in this course.

29
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,380
We'll build a web server with no chance.

30
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:58,920
So we got this Broadway versatility of being able to use javascript on different platforms and you can

31
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,020
also perform a broad variety of tasks with javascript Also depending on the platform you're running

32
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,440
on.

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,490
You can in the browser listen to user events read rendered the DOM and on the server or on a PC you

34
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,080
can work with files with databases.

35
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,900
Lot of cool stuff.

36
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,980
So this is a summary of javascript and what makes up the language.

37
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,560
Let's now dive into some core features also some core next generation telescope features which are supported

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,810
by no choice.

39
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,800
And let's see some things we'll see from the course.
