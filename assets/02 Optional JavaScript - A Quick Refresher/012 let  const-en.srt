00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:08,880
Now that I had a quick look at the very basics and the core turns you have to know let's dive into some

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,780
next gen javascript index you'll see for all this module and from this course waar is a key word that

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,380
creates a new variable.

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:26,370
And actually it's a bit of an outdated syntax from now on we'll use LET instead of war and let also

5
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,550
creates a variable the scoping behaves a bit differently but we can ignore that for now.

6
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:38,130
Here check out some NexGen javascript resource like my ears 6 course or of course all some free resources

7
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,220
to learn all about LET.

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:48,090
But the core reason for using Lepp is that we now also have another way of creating a variable and with

9
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,800
that I mean a variable which never changes which actually is the case for all free here.

10
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,310
But let's say we actually do assign a new value to age here but we never change name or has hobby's

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,470
we could absolutely use LET.

12
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,650
There is nothing strictly wrong with that.

13
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:10,070
But to be clear about our intentions in the code and we know it will never change.

14
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,310
Let name and has hobbies.

15
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,010
We can also use a new keyword available in javascript and that's a Konst keyword discreate creates a

16
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,660
so-called constant.

17
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,350
And this makes clear that we never plan on changing the value of name or has hobby's.

18
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,590
We do plan to change of age.

19
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:36,000
That is why we have let And that is the reason why we have two different keywords for creating variables

20
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,340
though.

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,570
Again these are not really variables there are constants either Konst or let depending on whether you

22
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,940
plan to change this or not.

23
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:52,980
So now if x Q Does it works in exactly the same way as before but by the way if I tried to set in name

24
00:01:52,980 --> 00:02:00,380
to Maximillian here and I do run node play chess again I actually get an error.

25
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:06,780
Now that I try to assign to a constant variable so does actually already shows us the idea behind Konst

26
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:14,070
and you want to use Konst as often as possible to be as clear about what happens in your code as possible

27
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,080
and if something should never change make it a contest so that you get an error.

28
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,930
If you do accidentally change it zero triggered this change.

29
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,610
But I want to show you how length and cons to work.
