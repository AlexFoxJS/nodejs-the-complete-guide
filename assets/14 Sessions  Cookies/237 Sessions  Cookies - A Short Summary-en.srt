1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,910
So now we had a look at how we can use sessions and what the advantage of a sessions.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:12,110
And we also of course learned about cookies what a cookie can be used for and how it plays together

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:19,670
nicely with a session to identify a user a client and then store the sensitive data on the server.

4
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:26,810
So in the session and that difference between sessions services and cookies client side is really important

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,730
to understand.

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,280
You also learned how to set a cookie and how to use a session.

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:38,150
By the way if you're wondering how that session cookie this cookie or how does a set all this is done

8
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,100
automatically by express session.

9
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,040
So by that middleware we're configuring.

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:49,010
That's also why you can add cookie related configurations here because this middleware automatically

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,440
sets a cookie for you and it automatically reads the cookie value for you too.

12
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:01,580
So does all the cookie parsing and setting for you now with that you actually really need to manage

13
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,910
cookies on your own.

14
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,250
Because dead session cookies.

15
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:09,860
And with that I don't mean a cookie which gets lost after you close the browser but that cookie that

16
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:17,150
identifies a server side session that is the most prominent The most common use case for cookies besides

17
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:23,180
advertisements tracking which you typically don't implement on your own but you use for party tools

18
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,550
like Google for that.

19
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,080
But that session took me so that session identifying cookie is an important thing.

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,710
And Sessions on the server are often used for all that occasion.

21
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,580
But as I mentioned you could use them for any kind of data you want to store.

22
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,640
We happen to store the information wherever the user is locked in.

23
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:48,020
But you could be storing the cards that the shopping cart user here or anything which belongs to a user

24
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,140
which should be shared across requests as I highlighted.
