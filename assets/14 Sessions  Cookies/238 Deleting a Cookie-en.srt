1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,370
We're now using sessions everywhere and we have our dummy authentication process in place it's missing

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,510
crucial features like log out and so on and that will all come and you'll find dictation module.

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,160
But we have something in place and you might have noticed that of course.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,090
Regarding the log out I always just deleted the session cookie.

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,770
That is what I did and the assignment to I deleted the session cookie to demonstrate what happens if

6
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,170
we don't try to do something that is relying on data that is stored in the session.

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:36,130
It will fail because the session cookie which is required to identify the correct session is there.

8
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,490
Now deleting just a cookie is of course not ideal because right now for example if you have a look at

9
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:47,990
compress and a intercessions collection I have free sessions here because I always just delete the cookie.

10
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:56,220
Now there is a cleaner way of doing that and that cleaner way is to use method provided by the session

11
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,030
middleware.

12
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,670
Now let me show this to you and find out.

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:07,890
First of all go to my views and they're to the navigation and next to my log in button here.

14
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:15,600
I'll actually add a number field another list item into which I'll add a form which should lead to log

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,050
out and use POST method.

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:28,320
And in that form I'll have a button like this which is of type submit where I'll say log out.

17
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:35,000
Now if we save that and we reload our page wesay log out next to log in.

18
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:41,150
Now to make sure the styling is correct we need to add that list item class here which we also have

19
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,920
on the list item here.

20
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,870
And after adding this if we reload this looks better.

21
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,560
And I've got my log out but you know when it clicked as I want to clear any session I might have.

22
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,670
And for that I of course need to register a new route.

23
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:02,240
So let's head over to our off routes and let's add a new poster out here because we will send a post

24
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,590
request which goes to log out and there will trigger a post log out action in my controller.

25
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,520
Now it is action of course does not exist yet.

26
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:17,060
So let's head over to the off controller and maybe duplicate the post log in route to your name and

27
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,800
post log out and in there.

28
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,440
What I want to do is I want to clear my session.

29
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,500
We can do this by reaching out to our session object and then we can call destroy there.

30
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,510
This is a method provided by the session package we're using.

31
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:40,790
Now this also takes a function which we passed to it which will be called once it's done destroying

32
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:46,580
the session and in their request session will then not be available anymore because we got rid of that

33
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,450
session.

34
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,500
We can recreate it for the next request.

35
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,520
When we do does it again then it will be sent again.

36
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,090
But in here all the session data will be lost because the session was destroyed.

37
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:04,520
So here I will then actually redirect back to my starting page with rest's redirect slash.

38
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:11,000
We also get a potential error here which we can try to log to the con..

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,030
Now with that we have to post log out to registered.

40
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,740
Now let's head back to our application and first of all let's log in.

41
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,600
Now let me hope the developer tools again.

42
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,360
I've got no session cookie here.

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:30,390
I can click log in and redirect that session cookie is set and we can now use that session.

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,310
Now if we go to Kompas real quick and we refresh we see we have four objects now which makes sense.

45
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,510
We had three before.

46
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,690
Now we have four.

47
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,620
And now let me click log out.

48
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,090
We are redirected the session cookie here actually still exists.

49
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:54,050
But you see the session was deleted over there and the session cookie still exists but that is no problem

50
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,570
because no matching session will be found.

51
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,920
So that is fine it's basically not doing anything.

52
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,490
And it will be renewed once you log in again.

53
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,070
Then this will all be overwritten.

54
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:09,040
And when we close the browser it will also be deleted because it's not a permanent cookie.

55
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:14,540
It's a session cookie which means it's a cookie that does not have expiry date in the future.

56
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,300
It does not have a max age.

57
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,380
It will simply get deleted when you close the browser and it's worthless in this state here.

58
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,780
So now as you see if I click around I have a problem with my orders here.

59
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,080
I'll fix that in a second.

60
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,140
But you see the cookies stare.

61
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,230
Most importantly the session was cleaned up.

62
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,990
Back there though.
