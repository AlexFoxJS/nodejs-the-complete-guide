1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,340
So I clicked at cart in the last lecture and we're now failing to do this.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,540
And if we go back we actually see an error or that request session user add to cart.

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,240
It's not a function.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:21,270
So we Semino fail to execute our Add to Cart function So basically our functions that normally are a

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,710
way lable on the user object.

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:34,170
And why is that the reason for that is that trivia Cely in previous setups we always store the user

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:41,640
in the request and does was up her request action anyways and we fetched dead user for every request

8
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,460
in the middleware in app.

9
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,210
Right.

10
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:51,570
So we fetch the user from the database and mongooses automatically gave us a full user object not just

11
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,790
the data in the database but the full user model with all the methods and we stored dead user model

12
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,020
in the request of the session.

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,960
This works have been different with the session.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,520
We are not fetching this for every request.

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,940
Instead we store a user in our session upon logging in here.

16
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,640
Now what happens to the user.

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,820
Well its gets stored to a database.

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,450
If we refresh there we can see here is our user object.

19
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,040
And this is now just the data.

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:29,490
Now for every new request the session middleware does not go ahead and fetch the user with the help

21
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,670
of mongooses it fetches the session data from long OTB.

22
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,940
That is correct but for it it uses them long would he be store and the mom would be store does not know

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,010
about our mongooses models.

24
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,280
So when it fetches the data from the session database when it fetches does data it only fetches the

25
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,640
data.

26
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,030
It does not fetch an object with all the methods provided by mongooses.

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,780
Now what can we do regarding that well.

28
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:04,170
One thing we can do of course and now were reporting back a bit we can reach at that middleware which

29
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:13,900
we had earlier here after we initialized our session.

30
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,420
So here I have my general middleware which we used before to store our user in the request and we can

31
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:28,050
take our logic from our post log in route where we fetch a user for a given ID move that back into that

32
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,580
middleware.

33
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,720
So exactly what we had before.

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,950
Instead of redirecting will call next so that the incoming requests can continue with the next middleware.

35
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,920
But in the here we dont want to store anything in the session because the session is already something

36
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,870
which will be managed for us automatically and 40 incoming requests we register the middle where the

37
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,670
middle where we'll then basically look for a session cookie if it finds one it will look for a fitting

38
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,610
session into a database and load data from there.

39
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,530
So by the time we reached his middleware we'll have our session data loaded.

40
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,650
Now this means that now we just want to use that session data to load our real user to create our mongooses

41
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,380
user model and how do we do that.

42
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,360
Well we don't need to reach out to the database again.

43
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,300
Instead we can again set the user Florida's request only.

44
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,170
And now here I want to create a user based on data stored in the session.

45
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:26,370
So data that persists across requests and I will create that user and store it in the request user which

46
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:32,560
will then only live for Dad request but it's fueled by data from the session and therefore it also survives

47
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,540
cross request.

48
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,210
You could say and I simply need to do that because I need a mongooses model to work with because the

49
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:46,260
data we store in the session storage in one load be there well we retrieve it as just plain data not

50
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:51,250
as a mongooses model with all the cool methods mongooses gives us and that is why we get this error

51
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,430
regarding add to card not being found and so on.

52
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,970
So here I will initialize request user and actually I don't want to find a user by id like this.

53
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:10,990
I will find the user by reaching out to request session user id it does make sense I guess because that

54
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:16,510
is the data the user is what is stored in my session and I want to get the idea and then find that user

55
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:21,340
in the database with the help of the user model which is provided by mongoose of course.

56
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:28,570
And then here I get back a mongooses model user which I store and request user and this is exactly what

57
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:34,810
I need now to make sure that I have a mongooses model to work with so that all these cool mongooses

58
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,850
methods work again.

59
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,900
And now we need to just admin JSM shopped as again and replace requests session user with request user

60
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,810
again because that is where I'm storing my mongooses model user.

61
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:53,760
So let's do that in shop genius and then all the files where I do use requests session user.

62
00:04:53,890 --> 00:05:00,880
I want to mark these all with command or control D and revert back to request user because now we store

63
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:07,630
our mongoose model in that request only object again do the same and admin japes.

64
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:13,350
So in not for locked in because that's just true or false we don't need to turn this into anything but

65
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:21,380
for all the places where I do use my request session user here.

66
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,490
All these places which should only be one here is now request to use her again.

67
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,670
Again this will not mean that it's now only X for this request.

68
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:35,640
The mongooses model object is but it's fueled by data that's stored in the session and therefore data

69
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,190
that persists across requests and knouted we saved all of that.

70
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,440
Let's go back and let's try adding this whole card again.

71
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:51,480
And now this works ASP for as long as I'm locked in if I do log out we now get an error that error is

72
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,610
now stemming from my app use function which is triggered for every request and this will simply fail

73
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,330
after logging out because request session user ID is not set there.

74
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,170
Well we can fix this in this app use function.

75
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:09,050
Actually yes by checking for the existence of requests session user.

76
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,760
And if we don't have one.

77
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:19,480
So if I don't have a user stored at my session then I can just call next and I return next so that the

78
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,220
code there after this one will not be executed.

79
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,000
This will only run if we do have a session user.

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,690
So now with that we can safely reload the starting page this works.

81
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,460
I can log in again I can add this to the card.

82
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,580
I can also add this from the card from the details page.

83
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,330
I can delete this and I can log out additional work.
