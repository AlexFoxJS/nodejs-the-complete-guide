1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,540
So knouted we learned a lot about sessions.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,340
Let me fix some things here real quick.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:13,810
For example if I go to my card or to my orders I have some issues there and the problem of course is

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:21,400
that without a valid session and we don't have a valid session now after destroying it all these methods

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,250
under all these actions where I do reach out to my user to fetch to occur and orders these will all

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,100
fail.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,340
And of course this makes sense because we need a secondary because we need a user for debt.

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,560
So what would work our shop and products and their details.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,410
Andrew Card will not work though.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,720
So a first step to improving debt besides checking for the existence of a user on the server which we

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,450
will all add in the indication module.

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:56,410
But first thing we can do is that we adjust our front end to only display things we can actually interact

13
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,080
with based on our current authentication status.

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,010
So for debt I'll go back to my views and I'll start with the navigation First of all because we can

15
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:12,700
all say that log in and log out should only be displayed should only be rendered when we are actually

16
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,380
not locked in.

17
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:21,260
So here I'm checking if we are often dictated to show ad product and Edmon products.

18
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:29,200
First of all this should move up and also include cart and orders because DS also only makes sense if

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,570
we have a user because otherwise Anbesol will get an error.

20
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:39,100
If you visit these pages and then we can repeat the logic down there and only showed this entire unordered

21
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,490
list.

22
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:50,040
If we are not indicated So if this is not true then I want to show these items.

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:57,150
Now we can also add this code and if we now save that and we reload this page we only see sharp end

24
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,680
products by default.

25
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:07,750
Once I log in though we see the rest well actually log out should be visible once we are authenticated

26
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,760
not to think about it.

27
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:15,980
So we should reverse this move that in there and only don't show this log in list item.

28
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,900
If we are not authenticated if we are often the case that.

29
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:29,160
So here we can use else if we are often educated then I of course want to show the log out screen.

30
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,750
Me get this correct here.

31
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,670
So now here I can now close this.

32
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:43,720
So now if I saved that again and I reload my page here I do see log out once Eclectus I.S. log in and

33
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,810
once I do log in again I see worse.

34
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,020
And now all of you are free to post a video.

35
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,680
Make sure for add to cart.

36
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,750
The same is true.

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,830
This should only be visible when you are locked in but not when we are locked out.

38
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,570
Here's your chance to post a video very successful.

39
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:09,850
It's actually the same logic because it is information we pass to every view anyways so therefore we

40
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:15,120
can go to the product list each fall where we doing collude Add to Cart.

41
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,730
So we should go to add to card actually and there.

42
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,190
This entire You should only be rendered if we can add the item to the cart.

43
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:29,140
So if we do have a session if we are authenticated and therefore let's go back to the product list doesn't

44
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,970
hire here should only be rendered if we are authentic.

45
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:41,920
So if it's ok authenticated is true then we'll include this year over y as we won't.

46
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:49,810
So now with this change if we saved it if I reload this page and I'm not locked in I still see it because

47
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:56,760
I'm on the wrong page for products this will work but for the index page this is a separate page.

48
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:04,030
In each case there we should also replace our include with that updated logic where we check for the

49
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,680
existence of our while locked in user.

50
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,680
So now with this added to index Aegeus to now either reload the starting page does is only there.

51
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:22,190
After I locked in as you will see now we can add to the cart and we fail again though.

52
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,150
Now why is that.

53
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,280
Let's check this in the next lecture.
