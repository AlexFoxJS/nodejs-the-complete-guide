1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,560
So he can manipulate cookies.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:09,340
So storing sensitive data is not ideal but I mentioned that for example for tracking users.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,770
It's a popular instrument and why is that.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:20,020
Because as you can for example see with the cookies I have here the cookies don't only have to relate

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,260
to your page.

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:29,770
A cookie can also be sent to another page that is a common instrument in tracking where you have that

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:35,310
so-called tracking pixel on pages which is simply image you are ill with no real image.

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:41,620
But that image can be located on let's say Google's servers and you have a cookie on that page which

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,390
is also sent along with that.

10
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,850
And therefore Google can track on which page you are and how you are moving through the web even if

11
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:54,790
you're not on their Web sites because some data is stored in your client and obviously you could delete

12
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,720
it therefore.

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,430
Which is why you can block such mechanisms too.

14
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,380
But it is stored there and it is sent with every request to Google so they can track you without you

15
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,680
being on their servers.

16
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:11,050
So storing that information on their servers would not work but storing it on your computer will work

17
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,630
because obviously that can be sent on every page you visit.

18
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:20,060
So that is something where it is could be interesting if you want to track your users.

19
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,520
That is a very common thing to do.

20
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,850
And you can also configure cookies.

21
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:30,010
We set a value but actually you can set more things than just the value here.

22
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,500
I set my cookie by adding that key value pair.

23
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,990
Now obviously we could add multiple cookies mult multiple key value pairs.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,770
We can also add a semi-colon after to the pair and for example set expires to some expiration date this

25
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:54,160
state would have to follow a certain format THAAD date format.

26
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,830
All linkit attached to it is video here.

27
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,450
So you could set a certain date when this cookie will expire because remember if you don't set this

28
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,830
it will expire once you close your browser.

29
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,540
Alternatively 2 x bars you can set max age written like this.

30
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,590
And this is a number in seconds how long that cookie should stay around.

31
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,060
So we could set this to 10 for example.

32
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,410
And now if I click that log in button here I got locked in.

33
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,210
And now you see the expiry date all have changed here the expiry date.

34
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:34,040
If I decreased debt the expiry date here basically is today and now it already is expired and if I reload

35
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,630
that page is locked and it's therefore gone.

36
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,300
So this is something we can do.

37
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:45,130
And this is of course interesting if you want to control for example how long you want to track a user

38
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,250
or we will actually use that together with authentication later.

39
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,530
You could use this to all control how long and authenticated sessions stays active for a user.

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,690
You might know that from your online bank where you time out after a certain duration you can all to

41
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,060
add a domain to which to cookies should be sent.

42
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,350
And here we again are on that tracking thing again.

43
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,560
You can add secure just like this without an equal sign just secure.

44
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,950
This means this cookie will only be set if the page is served y.

45
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,240
H t d p s.

46
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:23,660
Now I can demonstrate this here because our local development is not using HVAD b.s. but we will eventually

47
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,230
use HTB us later in the course where it will show you how to set this up.

48
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:34,040
So now you can already see how ever that I get an error if I try to reload log in because I try to extract

49
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,110
the value which is not there.

50
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:42,710
So for now let's simply comment this out and set this always to false so that I can just show you how

51
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,140
this cookie is now not set.

52
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:49,880
If I reloaded and click here you don't see the cookie here because I added secure and it would only

53
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,370
be set if we are serving each page.

54
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,900
Why are HTP.

55
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,700
And you can also set this to HTP only.

56
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,280
Now if I do that they go back to log in and I click here.

57
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,540
It is set but now it has this checkmark here in the HTP column.

58
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:11,310
And that means that now we can't access to cookie value through client side javascript.

59
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,880
So in the scripts running in the browser this can be an important security mechanism because it protects

60
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,780
us against cross-site scripting attacks now.

61
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,760
Because now your client side javascript where someone could have injected that malicious code can't

62
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,610
read your cookie values and that will be important later with authentication where a cookie will not

63
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:38,820
stored the sensitive information but an important part of authenticating the user.

64
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,020
So this can be an extra security layer because now the cookie will still be attached to every request

65
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,470
that is sent to the server.

66
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,270
But you can't read the cookie value from inside the browser Javascript code.

67
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,100
Obviously as you can tell as a user and developer tools you can still read it.

68
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:01,730
But then again it's your own cookie and you will not store information like hey I'm locked in there

69
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,430
because Dad would be easy to manipulate and you can't protect against that.

70
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,310
These are the key values you can set here.

71
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,600
And this gives you a lot of flexibility.

72
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,620
That being said often you will not directly set your cookies because you robery use some packages like

73
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:26,390
for example for authentication that will manage setting the cookie for you and that is something which

74
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:33,560
I'll dive into in the next lectures where we dive into sessions what sessions are how they can help

75
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:40,880
us with storing sensitive information across requests and how cookies still are important when using

76
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,510
sessions.
