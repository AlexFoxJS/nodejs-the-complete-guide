1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:09,090
So let's work on that log in page and forget First of all add new routes file which all name off J.S.

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,810
and in there I want to manage my authentication related routes.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,660
Now for that I will first of all set this up in a similar way to my eyebrowed files which means I will

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,730
set up the Express router.

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,860
So let me simply create that here.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:33,570
We don't need the admin control though so we have that router and an export led router and for now I

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:42,210
need one get out in here get route for Slash log in then which will load the log in page.

8
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,640
So slash log in is what I want to handle here.

9
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:53,340
And as always we have our request response the next function here for handling that incoming request.

10
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:00,930
Now in order to reach that route we of course need to register it in the app js file and in app J.S..

11
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,910
First of all let's import that route.

12
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,080
So I'll duplicate my shop routes name them all routes the name is up to you of course and it's in the

13
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,900
off file in the routes folder.

14
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,220
So that file we just added and wifi off routes there.

15
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,840
I would simply add them below my shop routes just like the shop routes.

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,680
I have no leading filter.

17
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,980
So every request will go in there and anything which is not found in the shop routes will therefore

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,090
go into the off routes and the off routes it will handle.

19
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,680
Slash log in this route here now here.

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,900
I simply want to render a page and I want to render a page in let's say off folder and just as I do

21
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,280
this in the shop controller here I will also create a off controller for dad.

22
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:58,010
So let's maybe duplicate does get orders action from the shop controller added here.

23
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,680
And let's name it.

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,080
Get log in.

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,050
And then I don't need to find any orders or anything like that.

26
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,920
Dead of course can be removed.

27
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,570
I just want to render something.

28
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,470
I want to render off log in here.

29
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:19,590
The possibility slash log in your orders Well I will simply nameless log in and I don't pass any other

30
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,090
data.

31
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,010
So it's a really simple controller action in my office last fall and with that in the off Chia's file

32
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,300
in the route's folder I can simply import dat.

33
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:39,110
So here I will import my off controller by requiring that from the control of folder and the website

34
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,910
off file there.

35
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:48,640
And then here for log in I will not use the function but point at my controller with the get Logan function.

36
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:55,560
Ok so now we get the same setup we used for the other routes and now we have that log in controller

37
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,270
action which will render the log in page with the appropriate title.

38
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,190
Now let me head over to navigation.

39
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,620
E.J. asks a real quick and make sure that this gets highlighted when we are on the page.

40
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,510
And for that I will copy that class assignments that see is as class assignment editor here.

41
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:20,980
And the payoff should be slash log in or whatever you assigned in your controller action.

42
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,580
With that out of the way let's add that folder and file in the views folder.

43
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,380
So we'll add an off folder here and in there a log in.

44
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:36,150
E.J. last fall because that is just what I try to render my controller right there.

45
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,430
I tried to render off log in.

46
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:47,830
So we need to have that lbf and file in our views folder and for that I will really just use my product

47
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:54,550
me in my admin edited product page because there I have a form and I will move that into the log in

48
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,690
Ejaz fall.

49
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,900
I will include head yes.

50
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,610
I don't need to product C as s but I need the forms.

51
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,500
C S S.

52
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:10,630
I will include the navigation then this year will receive a new class we can name this log in form and

53
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,110
see how we have to adjust the styling for that.

54
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,480
Then the action here well that action will always be the same.

55
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,050
We don't have different modes here.

56
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,430
The action is always log in and we send the post request to log in route and then here let's say we

57
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:33,860
have an email address we name that field email here and we give it an ideal email.

58
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,500
It's all of type email and all of type text.

59
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,360
And let's not start with a default value so we don't need that here.

60
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:48,720
And we all need a password let's say let's add password to your name this password and give it an ID

61
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,020
of password and to type here will also be password so that the characters are hidden.

62
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,600
And with that we get rid of this value here.

63
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,290
Now we don't need the phone controls so we can get rid of these form controls.

64
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:11,250
Also of the hidden one for now and let's simply add a button at the bottom which is of type submit and

65
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,740
which simply says log in.

66
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,150
So really simple form with all of that in place.

67
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,520
If we now click onto that log in button we are in d loading that log in page.

68
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,610
Now the styling is a bit off because we need to style that log in form and that our real quick ad.

69
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,660
And you see as a file which I'll name off SEUS as an in there on the log in form.

70
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,550
Let's have a look at the product form.

71
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,290
I think we can just reuse that style here.

72
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,840
And yes we could have therefore all Azel like refactored it into a global style but I'll just do it

73
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,960
like this and then log it Ejaz.

74
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:54,750
We now just make do need to make sure that we do also import that new offices as Falah just added.

75
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,000
So if you now reload this this looks pretty good.

76
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,480
So now we got this in place.

77
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,810
And as I mentioned I will not implement a full log flow right now.

78
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,690
We'll do that in the next module where we dive into authentication and everything that belongs to it.

79
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:15,530
But here I want to show you how we can use a cookie to save information that this user is locked in.

80
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,540
And that will continue in the next lecture and see how we can use cookies.
