1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,640
So we had to look at cookies.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,240
What is a session.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:11,360
Well we have the same set up as before user using the front end our use interacting with our server

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,160
where we have our node application code we send the request and we do log in.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,330
And again let's assume we do is send a valid credential stare.

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,350
We're not validating them in this module because I want to focus on sessions and cookies.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,150
So now instead of storing the information that the user is authenticated in the front and which was

8
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:37,970
a bad place as we learned we'll stored in the back end with a so-called session and A session and you

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,400
construct which we haven't used before.

10
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,900
With that I'm not meaning that we stored it in the request because we already saw that this will not

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,530
work.

12
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:52,250
And I also don't mean that we store it in some variable in our express app because Dad would be shared

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,280
across all users and all requests.

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,440
We only want to share the information across all requests of the same user and that's really important

15
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,900
the same user sort of Abra users can see your data.

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:12,390
Assume your role can't tell the server that they are offended Kheta only you are authenticated.

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,020
Now for that we need to store it on the server.

18
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:21,260
We'll start by storing it in memory which is then pretty similar to storing in that variable.

19
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,480
But eventually we'll move to a different session storage that database and we need one important piece

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:34,880
of information a client needs to tell the server to which session he belongs because the session will

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,650
in the end just be an entry stored in memory or stored in a database.

22
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:45,680
Now we're not matching this by IP address or anything like that because that is a bit hard to maintain

23
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,440
and can be faked and all that fun stuff.

24
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,770
So we're not doing that.

25
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,000
Instead we'll use a cookie where we will store the ID of the session.

26
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:02,150
Now obviously you can still change that and assume a different ID if you want to but that will not work

27
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:09,440
like this because actually the value we store will not be d d id but the hashed ID hashed with a certain

28
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:15,890
algorithm where only the server can confirm that it has not been fiddled with so that you didn't play

29
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,030
around with it and tried to create a different one.

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,710
So this will be a secure way because you basically stored the ID in an encrypted way where only the

31
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:31,610
server is able to confirm that the stored cookie value relates to a certain ID in the database.

32
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,290
And therefore we got a safe value stored in the cookie which you can't.

33
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,700
You can change it but you will not assume a different session.

34
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,680
A session can be matched and that session can then contain the confidential data which you can't change

35
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,340
from inside the browser.

36
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,650
That is the idea here.

37
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:54,390
So sessions are stored on the server side cookies client side sessions service side.

38
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,480
Now let me show you how to implement a session.
