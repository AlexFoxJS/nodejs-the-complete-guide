1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,330
Last but not least let's make sure we can also delete data so that you see that last part of the drug

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,670
operations with mongooses as well.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:17,820
For that we got our Postol product action and I'm calling delete by ID here on my product model.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:25,170
Now if I have a look at delete you'll see this is not something offered by mongooses.

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,850
However we do with find by id and remove and dead is exactly what we want here right.

6
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,900
So if we call that then we've got everything we need.

7
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,840
This is a built in method provided by Mungo's that should remove a document.

8
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,660
And now we can go to the admin route's again comment in that last Edmon route again.

9
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,260
Save that.

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,180
And with that being saved if I now click delete.

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,470
No products are found and we can of course also confirm this in comp as if I refresh there are no documents

12
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,390
in the product collection.

13
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:04,630
So this is how we can work with mongooses and do basic craft operations with it.

14
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:12,370
Now let's again add a user and see how we can relate different entities with mongooses So how we can

15
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,730
manage relations.

16
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,230
And let's then add that cart and orders thing again.
