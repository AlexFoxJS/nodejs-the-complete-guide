1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:09,200
In the last module we had a closer look at no sequel or especially among or D.B and how you can use

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:16,360
such a no sequel database in our course would be the most popular no non-sequel database in a no JSA

3
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,630
application.

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:23,350
Hopefully you saw that it wasn't too difficult and still just as we have sequel.

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:30,890
We can abstract some complexity away from us and focus more on our data than the queries we write and

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:38,090
here just as we had sequel eyes for a sequel we got mongoose for Mongo DV and mongooses is indeed pretty

7
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,250
similar to sequels in terms of what it tries to do.

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,470
It tries to enable you to work with the data instead of with the queries.

9
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:52,250
So what's in this module will have a look at what mongooses is in detail and how we can add it to our

10
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,760
project and how we can start using it and then we'll.

11
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,900
Well we will use it.

12
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,520
We will use our no chess application.

13
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:05,390
I will give you a thorough introduction to Mangu is also show you where you can learn more about that

14
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,040
if you want to dive deeper.

15
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,630
And we will transform our project once again to move from A.

16
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:18,440
We write all queries on our own approach to q we just define how our data should look like and then

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,080
work with it approach.

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,530
So that let 7.
