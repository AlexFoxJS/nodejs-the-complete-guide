1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,530
Now first of all let me show you the official docs.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,800
You can always wizard mongooses jast dot com.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,680
And there you can dive into the full docks to learn everything about mongoose all its details all its

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,240
advanced features which will not cover in this course because this is not a good course.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,460
I just want to give you an introduction to Mangu is here so everything can be seen in great detail here.

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,970
But that being said I will walk you through all the core fundamentals in this course and in this module

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,390
of course and we'll also keep on using mongoose for the rest of this course.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,010
So we'll gradually use more features as we add more features to our application like authentication

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:41,970
and so on.

10
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,180
So this is how you can learn more about mongoose.

11
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:52,290
Now to add to our project I quit my NPM start process and then I can simply run NPM install dash dash

12
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,630
save Mangu is like dead.

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,450
That is the name of the package.

14
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:03,150
Now this will download and added to our project and then we are already ready to start using it.

15
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,040
And the first thing we want to do when we started using it is that we want to connect to our database

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:16,350
and for that we could use our database utility file here but actually mongooses all of that utility

17
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:22,650
management and the management of that connection behind the scenes for us what we can do is we can get

18
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:30,890
rid of the database Cheras file and we can go to the objects file and in there simply import mongoose.

19
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,140
So here let's import mongooses by requiring mongooses.

20
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,360
Mongoose like this.

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:45,210
And with Mangu is imported we can set up a connection so down there where I used my own Mongo connect

22
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:55,300
I can use mongooses like this and then there there is a connect method we can use now that connect method

23
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:00,880
takes these same you are all we used for connecting before.

24
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:06,850
So make sure you grab that your Al from your back and again and entered at here.

25
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:13,090
Make sure you're using the right user which you set up for that and of course enter your password.

26
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,240
And this will now connect to mongooses.

27
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:23,190
Then you get a promise here or you can call then at least and there you'll get to the result of this

28
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,490
connection but most importantly you noted at this point of time you are connected.

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,270
So here I also want to bring up my notes server or to be precise.

30
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,610
Start listening for incoming requests.

31
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,010
I can also add a catch block here and log any potential error.

32
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,610
I might be getting when trying to get connected.

33
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:49,000
So with this we already have everything in place we need to connect and Mangu is as I mentioned we'll

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,870
managed to add one connection behind the scenes for us.

35
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:57,050
So that and other places where we start using mongoose from the Magoo's package we use that same connection

36
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:03,210
we set up here really convenient of course and that already leads us to the next thing we have to do.

37
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:10,680
We have to move our code over to mongooses now and not to use them on the DVD drive or directly as we

38
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,900
are currently doing it.

39
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,790
So will again have to rewrite all our models but I hope you still see the advantage of this.

40
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,740
You first of all learn how to use to Mangu the driver and you could of course stick to that and continue

41
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,200
using that if you wanted to.

42
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,940
But now I will show you how you can move that over to Mangu is to focus more on how your data should

43
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,590
look like and less on all the logic for it interacting with the database.

44
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:41,550
Now to move over again I do something I did before I will comment out my dear friend route's here in

45
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:47,910
the shop chastened and the admin shares fall so that we can gradually comment them back in as we make

46
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,310
them work again.

47
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:57,470
Now with all route's commented out if I run NPM start I get an error of course that you tell database

48
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,280
was not found in Aperture.

49
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:05,640
Yes I'd certainly have to get rid of that import here where I do import something from that database.

50
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,370
And the same is of course true for my models where I do also import something from the database.

51
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,660
Now the problem is if I comment that out nothing will work here anymore.

52
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:21,430
And therefore I will simply comment out everything in my models for the moment.

53
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,340
Now with that it looks like we are connected because we don't get any error here.

54
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:33,420
This warning can be ignored and therefore we now are connected to our same long would be server.

55
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:40,900
But now by using the mongoose package with that set up let's start working on all our models and all

56
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,890
our code to make it to work with mongooses in the next lecture.
