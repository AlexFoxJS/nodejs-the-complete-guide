1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,050
With the user model set up let's make sure we can use it together with the product model.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,000
Now obviously every product should be assigned to a user.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,890
So first of all we need to change our product schema a little bit.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,850
A product should also have a user ID field let's say just as we had it before in the last module.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,630
Now a user ID field is of type and Now which type estus.

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:34,860
Well it won't be a reference to a user so this will actually be of type schema types object ID.

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,880
And now we Kensit something special here we can add a special ref configuration and ref takes a string

8
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:49,010
where we tell mongooses Hey which average mongoose model is actually related to the data in that field.

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,380
We know that we will store a user ID here but just because the type is object id This is not obvious.

10
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,010
This could be any object ID of any object.

11
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:06,580
So I will add user here and you use the name off your model to which you want to collect this.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,080
So since our model here is named user I will name it user here.

13
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,190
So I referred to my user model here.

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,720
And with that I got a roll lation set up does also means that in my user model where I do store and

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,640
a product ID I can also add a reference here and refer to product because I know that for every user

16
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:37,830
in the cart items I will store products where I refer to some ID and that Id happens to refer to a product

17
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,540
stored or defined through the product model.

18
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,510
So now we got relation's set up with ref.

19
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,390
Of course you only need this when using references when using embedded documents as we do with the cart.

20
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,490
You don't need to do anything because while you use an embattled document this already has kind of an

21
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,280
implicit relation that is managed inside of one document.

22
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,640
So now with the reference a set up.

23
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:10,990
Let me also add a required to true here and now I adjusted my schemes now with this schema adjusted

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,140
be of course need to adjust our code like in the admin control or when we create a new product when

25
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,560
creating a new product we also want to make sure we store the user id and that is super simple.

26
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:30,770
We just add user ID here to the fields we pass in the object to the product constructor and now remember

27
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:39,640
that we did save the user in our request so it can just do request user underscore Id like this and

28
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,490
this should give me access to the user id and assign it here now conveniently in mongooses.

29
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,280
You can even just store the entire user object.

30
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,350
So this is really the entire user Optik not just the ID and Mungo's will just pick the ID from that

31
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,080
object.

32
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,440
So thats a narrow convenience you got there.

33
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,820
Let me save my code.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,160
Let's go back and lets add a new product a nice book.

35
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,370
Lets use that image your L we used before.

36
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,200
Lets give it some prize.

37
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:15,820
You should not miss that and click add product now you zip.

38
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,330
That looks good it was added.

39
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,880
And now let's have a look at compas and see if the user ID was added to.

40
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:29,360
So if I refreshed there indeed we see the user id here and just the ID not the entire user just the

41
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,740
ID as we wanted.

42
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,220
So this is pretty awesome.

43
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,450
This is how we can manage relations through mongoose.

44
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,650
Now let me show you something cool.

45
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,660
When it comes to fetching these relations.
