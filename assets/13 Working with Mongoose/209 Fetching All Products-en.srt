1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,510
Knouted we're able to save products.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,310
Obviously we again want to be able to fetch up.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,600
So let's head over to the shop yes.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:16,750
Fall in the control us folder and let's start working on get products and get index action star so we

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,750
can indeed fetch all products.

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:23,020
Now we got no fetch all Methot in mongoose.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:28,780
That was a method we defined on our own but we can still use something on the product model which we're

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:35,170
still importing from the product bottles folder and which is the mongoose model and yet and there we

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,970
got a couple of static methods.

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,470
You can find all in the official docs of course.

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,030
And one of them is the find method which you already know from them on would be driver.

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,740
Now find works a bit differently when used with mongoose.

13
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,840
It does not give us a cursor.

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,970
Instead it does give us the products we could add dot cursor and call this to get access to the cursor

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,160
and then use each async which would allow us to loop through them or next to get the next element.

16
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:10,550
But I will just use find and this will essentially give me all my products automatically.

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:16,470
So then in products I should get my products and I should be able to output them.

18
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,450
So if I now console log my products here sort of we can also see them.

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:28,240
We we have to go to the shop route as well and there we want to include to get a next route and to get

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,420
products out.

21
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:35,550
And since I also did include to get in route here I of course also need to work on get index in my shop

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:43,480
js file in the controller's folder there we all want to use find instead of fetch all but that should

23
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,020
be it.

24
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,750
If we now save everything and we go to the products page.

25
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,460
Indeed I do see my product here.

26
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,620
So this is looking good.

27
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,990
And if I go back well then I see here is the output of the data that was fetched.

28
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,670
And you see I get an array here because I find when used with Mangu is automatic.

29
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,230
It gives me that array year.

30
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:07,270
Now again if you know you will query large amounts of data you should turn this into a cursor.

31
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,510
Or of course manipulate find to limit the set of data that is retrieved something we will see in the

32
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,470
page anation module later in the course.

33
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,490
So here I now got my work in get products and get indexed route.

34
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,540
Let's next work on the detail route for a single product.
