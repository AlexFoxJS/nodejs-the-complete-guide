1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,620
So in this module you'll learn about mongoose and I can only encourage you to dive into the official

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,350
mongooses documentation to learn all about it and the many features it offers.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,300
And I do really mean it as I said in the last lecture.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,240
Play around with our application.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,950
Try adding subgoals or total's to our orders here.

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,410
Play around feel free to experiment with the data and with our application.

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,880
This is what coding is all about.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,850
In the end the official talks for more gurus and long would be or sequel Aizen sequel if you want to

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,450
stick to that should give you everything you need to dive deeper and play around.

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,270
At this point of course though you have a solid understanding of the different database solutions you

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,360
could use how you would use them.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,880
Why using tools like sequel eyes or mongooses might make a lot of sense and how you can integrate them

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,540
into your application.

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,500
Now what exactly you use.

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,510
Which database and which features or which package always depends on your exact application.

16
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,180
I hope that disallowance modules gave you a great overview over the pool of options you could choose

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,700
from and what you can do with them.

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,300
We will continue with mongooses and longer DBI in this course.

19
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,160
However feel free to of course play around with sequel if you need that for your next project.

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,630
But we will continue with that.

21
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:24,450
We will therefore add some features from the cores do a bit more with the database when we are able

22
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,110
to do it.

23
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,710
Like for example invalidate input and build our application whilst at the same time learning way more

24
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,530
about node and express in general throughout the rest of this course.
