1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,210
So let's clear the card after storing an order.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:11,250
And for that here once I'm done with saving the order I want to clear the card.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,310
And one way to do that would be to go to the user model and add a new method there.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:23,450
We can go to the user schema to the methods key and then add a clear cart method.

5
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,770
So simply a function of we can call to clear the entire cart.

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,340
And how would we do that.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:37,020
Well we would simply set this cart equal to an object where we have an empty array of items and then

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:45,390
we just return this whoops return this safe and that should be it that updates to cards you have no

9
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,000
items in it anymore and we didn't save as and therefore we update this which is let's go back to the

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,160
shop controller.

11
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:58,930
And here once we know that the order was placed let's simply call request user clear card.

12
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:08,400
This method we just added and then I will return that and move my redirection into a new then block

13
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,400
after the previous one which will only execute once the card was cleared.

14
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:22,300
So now with that let's say that let's now also go to products and maybe add another product to our cart.

15
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,750
Let's order that card.

16
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,400
Now let's click on card again no products and cart does this looking great.

17
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:34,670
Let's quickly check our orders and compacts and this new order should now have two product set is looking

18
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,160
good.

19
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:41,050
One with quantity Q That walls are nice spoke and one with quantity one that was the second product.

20
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,240
And in the users the card is empty.

21
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:50,960
So now we got an elegant way of managing orders sent the cart through mongoose.

22
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,030
However of course also had the functionality to get the card in the next lecture.
