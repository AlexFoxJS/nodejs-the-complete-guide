1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:08,320
Now that we're able to get all products let's also make sure we can get a single product and for that

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:15,140
I'll work on my get product action in their shop controller and then we extract the product that which

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:15,800
is great.

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,950
I don't need Dischord here anymore.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,540
By the way.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,120
And the good thing is product is a mongoose model and Mangu is indeed has a fine by the method.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,790
So little convenience method that defines for us.

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:35,440
So I again find by a d here it's not our own method it's defined by mongooses and best of all we can't

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,440
even pass a string to find by id and mongooses will automatically convert this to an object ID.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,750
So it will handle data for us as well.

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,990
So again getting a lot of that convenience by just using mongooses.

12
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,610
And then we should be able to get back a product and use that.

13
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,010
So actually this should be everything we need to do.

14
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:55,680
Nothing.

15
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:56,870
Basically I guess.

16
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,380
One thing I have to do of course is I have to comment that route back and so does route for loading

17
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:09,940
a single product with that if you save everything and you click on details here we indeed see the detail

18
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,970
page for this product.

19
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,120
So this is now also working.

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:22,060
And that of course is really great because well this allows us to easily adjust our code to use mongoose.
