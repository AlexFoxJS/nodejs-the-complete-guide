1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,240
Now did we learn a lot about validation.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,700
Sanitising input.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,650
Let's practice this one less time for adding a product and for editing it as well and there feel free

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:20,610
to again possed a video and try out some things on your own add your own first validation steps offered

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,620
a pause do together of course and you're free to add any validation that you want to add that looks

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,950
good to you for the different fields we have here.

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,830
Your offer I'll show you my suggestion on how we could validate this.

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,480
So here's your chance to post a video

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,390
successful.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,330
Well let's try it out.

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,380
We get for it.

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,120
What's your title image your price and description.

13
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,710
Now what would make sense to be validated here.

14
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,410
And again there is no single true solution here.

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,780
You can have different requirements for deep your building.

16
00:00:53,870 --> 00:01:00,770
Now I want to have a title which should be alphanumeric so only normal alphabetic characters and numbers

17
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,700
should at least be let's say free characters long D-Mich. you or else should be valid.

18
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,810
You are l.

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:15,530
The prize should be a floating point number so a number with decimal places and the description your

20
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,130
should also be not alphanumeric.

21
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,810
There should be special characters like the exclamation mark should be allowed but it should be at least

22
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:31,520
let's say 5 characters long and with that information let's add validation to the Edmund J.S. fall which

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,760
is where we have eddys post routes for whip's for adding and for editing for them.

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:44,400
First of all let's import the body or to check function whichever you prefer.

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,700
By requiring

26
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,550
express validate or slash.

27
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:58,250
Check and then let's edit here to add product there.

28
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:05,190
I'll add an array to group all these mealworms together and then all validate my different inputs.

29
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,520
Step by step.

30
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:14,810
Let's first of all have a look at the views real fast so there at the added product view and there we

31
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:21,700
see we got a field named title one named image Eurail one named price and one named description.

32
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,170
So these are the four fields I want to validate.

33
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,900
Title image your price and description.

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,560
So back in the admin controller excuse me in the aplan route not the controller in the route.

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,260
I'll start with the title.

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,150
Now there you're free to add whatever you want.

37
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:47,650
I will add is alpha numeric as a validator and is length should have a minimum length of 3.

38
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:54,890
Let's say we can also add some sanitization and trim excess whitespace at the beginning or the end of

39
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,910
the title.

40
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,000
Now this is the title I want to validate.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,460
Now copy this and continue with the image you are l.

42
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,860
However there I will check is u r l.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,710
That is the only thing I want to validate there.

44
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,630
That this is valid.

45
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,190
You are L and that is a number built in validator that checks whether dis fulfills the characteristics

46
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,000
of a u r l.

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,790
Then I'll add my validator for the price here.

48
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:36,200
Now for a price I want to have I could check it is numeric to allow either integer values or floating

49
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,040
point numbers.

50
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:43,520
But there all this is float to ensure that this has to have some decimal places.

51
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:51,140
Now I'll add my last days here and that will be on the description and there I just want to trim that

52
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,690
and have a length of at least let's say 8 or 5 characters whatever you want.

53
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,360
You could also add a max of all you of course.

54
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:05,820
Let's say we have a max of 200 or 400 characters something like that.

55
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:13,690
No added validation to adding a product are already copy that and edit to edit product here to the post-road

56
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,400
edit product as well.

57
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,790
So dare I edit the exact same fields because we'll be editing the exact same fields there.

58
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,870
So I want to have the same validation emplace.

59
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,340
Now with that in place let's go to the Abin controller and make sure we collect these validation errors

60
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,640
and return them for that.

61
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:40,990
Well first of all import something from the Express validator by requiring express validators slash

62
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:50,530
check and there I want to import the validation result function and then post at product here before

63
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,700
we create new product.

64
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,980
I will actually collect all my errors by passing the request to validation result and will then check

65
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:06,310
if not errors is empty which means we do have errors and in that case if we make it into this if block

66
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,540
I will actually render my edit page.

67
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,730
So here on get edit page I will call this render function you're in the end.

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,780
But I'll do that in this if block I just edit.

69
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:26,410
I'll also set this status code of 422 which is a good practice for indicating to the browser that some

70
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,680
data that was passed was incorrect.

71
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,860
I'll have ADD product as a title

72
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:42,550
and now if we have a quick look here at added product we see that there we already set the value.

73
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:48,370
If editing is set to true and then we are put product final product image you are.

74
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,690
Now we can tweak it as a little bit.

75
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,950
I'll still set editing to faults because we still are not editing and I don't want to change anything

76
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:07,310
else on the page but what I will do is all set my product here equal to an object where I do set the

77
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:17,080
Thailand's on Tuesdays fields to these inputs which I did fetch so at the title the image your L and

78
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:24,900
also the price and the description Trudy's fetched inputs so that we can use that old data in the way

79
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,560
we are already using it.

80
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:35,190
But I'll now add a number field here has error or maybe and I'll set this to true here.

81
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:41,090
Now that simply means that I should ensure that has error is all set and other places where I render

82
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:48,860
it as page like here where I set it to false for get at product and for get edit product down there.

83
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,070
I will also set it to false.

84
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:57,010
So it's only true right now if I'm in the if block of my post at product road here.

85
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:03,860
Now in my view I can now take advantage of this new has Arrowfield and I can say I want to output the

86
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:10,920
existing product title if I'm editing or if his error is true.

87
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:17,100
So that is my alternative condition here to ensure that the old data in this case then is output like

88
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,960
this.

89
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,470
Now of course it would also be nice to display some error message so we can grab that from the logon

90
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:34,600
page and check for the existence of error message here above my form and output it.

91
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:40,950
If we have one this just means that again back to my routes and not to my routes to my controller and

92
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:51,740
the Edmond Chia's file we should have an error message which simply is null by default.

93
00:07:51,830 --> 00:08:01,110
And here in my IF block where I do have validation errors I will set the error message to errors array

94
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,850
the first error which we are guaranteed to have.

95
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,060
And they're DMSO Schieber property property as we did before.

96
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:15,610
And of course all those that error message here when we get the added page there I set it to null and

97
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:23,250
now with that if I hit add product to your I get invalid value because I set no custom errors.

98
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:30,760
But it did to be rendered this never entered first book here then kept the I ad at product it still

99
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,430
gives me that old message of invalid value because I never set my own one.

100
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,070
You could of course do that with the techniques as showed.

101
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:42,970
We also have no red borders because we didn't at that logic yet but it is reloading the page it's not

102
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:47,180
submitting the request and it's keeping all the data which we did input.

103
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,650
Right so this is not thrown away and that is of course worth a lot.

104
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,400
We can of course also edit products and for this.

105
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,860
Let me quickly add a valid product.

106
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,880
This also allows us to test whether this works

107
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:11,100
and it looks like it failed but actually if we go back we see we get double headers sent error which

108
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:17,790
is stemming from my Edman controller I should return is otherwise after sending this error response

109
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,750
that we continue with the rest of our code which I don't want to.

110
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,280
If I had ADD product here.

111
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,010
This still fails though.

112
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:32,740
The interesting thing is if I go back to my product's collection first book was added before though

113
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,120
while that was added because I did not return in case of an error as I'm doing now.

114
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,180
So now the returning works but still I get this invalid value.

115
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:48,790
And if you want to find out for what I get it I can log errors array here so that we can have a look

116
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:55,150
into this Aeros object if I add this again no it fails of course we see it's the title the title failed

117
00:09:55,150 --> 00:10:03,060
somehow the title somehow is valid in a way that tells us that it does not fulfill our criteria.

118
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:10,630
And the title for adding a product should be alphanumeric have to length and be trimmed.

119
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:18,700
Now the thing is my alphanumeric check the whitespace here is NEVER alphabetic character nor a number.

120
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:26,230
So maybe we should just check if it is a valid string because that will allow whitespace as well.

121
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:34,470
And now if I had ADD product now this succeeded and it did add it therefore And I've got two first books

122
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,050
here.

123
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,620
Let me delete this real quick.

124
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,250
Now if I try adding this again though maybe a second book

125
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,170
it does work.

126
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,360
And now it also shows that image correctly so seems to have been a bug.

127
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,130
So this is now working now we added validation for adding this.

128
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,880
And how is it for editing FedExed animation mark here.

129
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,010
This is except that we see the exclamation mark up there.

130
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:12,750
And if I now enter something incorrect like the price is missing Well then this seems to break it doesn't

131
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,650
continue.

132
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,050
And indeed I do have an error down there.

133
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,190
Which makes a lot of sense because what didn't we do yet.

134
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,600
Well we didn't at our error collecting an error returning to the editor's note.

135
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,920
We only worked on and thus far post ad product.

136
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:35,780
So the next video will take care that for editing a product we also get validation errors instead of

137
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,680
a broken app.

138
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,600
When we do submit invalid values.
