00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,990
Now what we've learned how to add users to our application.

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:13,720
Let's take a step backward and let's have a look at the important topic that is related to any visitor

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,810
no matter if he or she is of any kind or not interacting with your website.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,930
I'm talking about handling user input and most importantly that will be the topic of this module validating

5
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,000
that user input.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,020
They are offering us more.

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,770
It will have a look at why validation is important.

8
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:38,180
So what do I mean with validating user input and why would you want to do that.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,680
And of course how can we validate user input.

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,330
These are the core things and I will show you how you can ensure that the data you work with is really

11
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,560
that data and in the format you expect to get it.

12
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,900
So this is what will dive into in this module.

13
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,980
So let's see what exactly validation is and why we would want to add it.
