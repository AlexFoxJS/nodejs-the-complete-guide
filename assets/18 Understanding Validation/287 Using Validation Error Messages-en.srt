1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:07,440
So we added a very basic validation and we get back a message which you want your output.

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,730
So this already shows us how we can work with that validation model where we see had rendered that page

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,620
again and now we just need to make sure we don't output Object object here.

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:22,050
But a real error message we can do that in our sign up view of course.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,660
Here we got our error message thing and the error message which I am outputting here is simply an object

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,720
because it's that array and not a single field in there.

7
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,950
Now we just need to adjust some figure and then the controller instead of returning an array.

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,720
Let's say we always want to return the first error message.

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,500
Obviously you could change just to change the overall logic.

10
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,630
And you need to change it in a control action step 2 to output all messages.

11
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:52,330
But for now let's say we simply take the first one which we are guaranteed to have because we'll have

12
00:00:52,330 --> 00:01:03,410
at least one error and then there the message and now it is safe that and I do send just test again.

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,070
Now I get invalid values.

14
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,950
That is how we could output that message.

15
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,900
We cannot just output the message.

16
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,450
We can also customize it.

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,480
And we have to do that in the place where we added to our middleware.

18
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,050
So in the route's file off-Terra is e-mail.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,620
You can add do you with message function and this will always refer to the validation logic that was

20
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,870
right before it because you could add multiple checks here.

21
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:37,880
You could also add is alphanumeric to check that only contains numbers and key characters number characters.

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,770
So you could add multiple ones but with message will always refer to the validation method right in

23
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,610
front of it.

24
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:53,730
And there you could add please enter a valid email something like debt and if you add this with message

25
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,560
here you will see that if I enter just some text here I get.

26
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,400
Please enter a valid email.

27
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,030
So this is a way of working with the messages and also customizing it.

28
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,170
And I also mentioned that you can add more validators.

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,370
So let's have a look at this in the next lecture.
