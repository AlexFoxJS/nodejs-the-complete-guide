1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,900
Our Sign-Up validation is looking pretty good.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:11,090
But there is one thing which we are validating in a bit of a strange way right now and that is the fact

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,620
that the e-mail address is taken or not.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:19,140
Right now I'm doing that in my off controller and there by the way we will not need a password any more.

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,120
We're checking this ahead of time but an off.

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,270
Yes I do check for e-mail existence here.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:33,730
Now logically it what makes sense to check that as part of our validation right.

8
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,440
And the good thing is we can do that.

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,570
Let's grab this code where we find one user here let's grab that code.

10
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,870
And let's head over to the off office followed in the routes folder in there.

11
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:54,100
Let's first of all import our user model by requiring it from the models folder and then from the user

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,620
file.

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,750
So we need that.

14
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:02,220
And then here on my e-mail field I got this custom validator.

15
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,680
All common does code out because I want to keep it for you as a reference but now we'll add a more.

16
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,500
Well a check that makes more sense.

17
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:16,470
I will add my code here where I find one user with that e-mail address.

18
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,290
Now that e-mail address on the right side here is the value of course which you are validating because

19
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,690
we're doing this on the e-mail field.

20
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,600
So value will be the entry email I'm searching for that e-mail.

21
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,990
And then here if I have a user document Well then I will not do it with this flash message and so on

22
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:33,700
anymore.

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:43,250
Instead I'll just take that error message and inside of this if block which is inside of my then block

24
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:51,260
here I will return a new promise reject call that promises a built in javascript object and would reject

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,610
a basically throw an error or inside of the promise and I reject with this error message I used before.

26
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:04,040
What this means is that now ofter does then block I could add and never catch block to catch this but

27
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,630
I will not do that here.

28
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:16,390
Instead let's close our function curly braces and the normal brackets with a custom function.

29
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,410
And now what I'll do is I will return user find one.

30
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,350
Now what will this do.

31
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:30,750
The Express validator package will check for a custom validator to return true or false to return a

32
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,050
fro an error or to return a promise.

33
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:40,530
If it's a promise as that is the case with this because here we ultimately return a promise because

34
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,320
every Then block implicitly returns and you promise.

35
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:52,710
So if we return a promise then express validator will wait for this promise to be fulfilled and if it

36
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,570
fulfills with in our case nothing.

37
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:02,740
So basically no error Dennet's treats this validation as successful if it resolves with some rejection

38
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:08,790
and Yanto which will happen if we make it into the if block then express validator will detect dis rejection

39
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,610
and will store this as an error.

40
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:18,210
This message will then be stored as an error message and this is how we can add our own asynchronous

41
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,330
validation asynchronous because we have to reach out to the database which of course is not an instant

42
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,050
task but express validator will kind of wait for us here.

43
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:35,310
So now we have our own async validation of place and now we should still check for email existence but

44
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:42,090
we don't do it as a controller anymore because Dare I will in the end get rid of that entire user find

45
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:54,010
one thing here instead of will instantly start with B crypt and I'll also remove one pair of brackets

46
00:03:54,010 --> 00:04:00,850
at the bottom and this semi-colon and this catch block and now what I'd do with yours I instantly started

47
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:08,000
with hash in my password and so on creating that user because I can rely on the user to not exist already

48
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,150
inside of my controller because I do check for its existence ahead of time in my off JS route with the

49
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,820
help of that really Deshaun middleware.

50
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:22,010
So now let's go back and let's add a email address and a valid password.

51
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:28,040
All the user added already exists and indeed I get e-mail access already so that is great if I however

52
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:36,980
do add an email address that does not exist yet and I do enter valid passwords I get my Sign-Up page

53
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,250
here.

54
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,040
My log in page.

55
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:44,400
Because a user was created successfully so does know works and does how you can add async validation.
