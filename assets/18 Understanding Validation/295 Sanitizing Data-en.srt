1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,950
That we learned a lot about validation and providing a good user experience.

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,010
Now sometimes you also want to sanitize user input.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,770
Now what does sanitising mean for one on this validator page.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,840
So the packet which is used behind the scenes you don't just find all these validators you also find

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,950
a way lable sanitizers here and there you will see what they do.

6
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:30,230
For example what you can do is you can ensure that there is no excess whitespace in a string passed

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,480
by the user on the left or on the right.

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,380
You can normalize the e-mail which means it's converted to lowercase and things like that.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,370
So there are a couple of things you can do to make sure the data you get is not just valid but also

10
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,380
is stored in a uniform way.

11
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,580
So with without extra whitespace or anything like that.

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,730
So sanitising inport is all something that makes sense to be done.

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,490
Cross-site scripting attacks annotation which is a security feature is by the way is something I'll

14
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:06,500
cover in the security module this course so you'll focus on the visual sanitization for now not on security

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,200
relevant sanitising.

16
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,610
So this is what you can do.

17
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,620
Now how does sanitising in Port work though.

18
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,910
Well you do it in one step with validating.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,130
So in the reality folder and the off-Terra has fallen our example let's say the email here I want to

20
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,470
make sure that it's stored in a normalized way.

21
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,420
So lowercase not starting with the uppercase character no X whitespace.

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,180
Well I can do it just by changing a number Meffert offer my validation logic and there I can call normalized

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,400
e-mail which is one of these built in sanitizers which I showed you for the password we could trim it.

24
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:50,690
So here we could trim the password to remove excess whitespace course we can do the same for the sign

25
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:51,680
up here.

26
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,550
Besides our check here I also want to normalize to email once I'm done with it with sensitise with validating

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,010
and for the password I want to trim excess whitespace.

28
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:10,480
So again this is something which I can do here to sanitize user input and to see the result of that.

29
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:16,490
Let me actually connect to my database real quick with the help of combis my visual user interface here

30
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,700
and there in the users.

31
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:26,320
I get a bunch of users because I created some users for this module let me delete a couple of entries

32
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,690
here really quick just to clean this up.

33
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,010
Well actually delete them all.

34
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,070
And now let me create a new user.

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,530
Keep in mind I added sanitization.

36
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:48,910
Now if I enter test at test I'll come like this with an extra blank offered this and I enter my password

37
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,100
here with an extra whitespace at the end so I'll blank at the end.

38
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,870
Then I do already get an error because for signing up I do actually trm my password here but I don't

39
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,600
trim the confirming password.

40
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,680
So should trim does as well.

41
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:11,170
Otherwise the whitespace is removed here and indeed it is just one character shorter Niva sign up both

42
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,060
passwords were changed and we keep in mind the email started with a capital character and also had extra

43
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,110
whitespace.

44
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:23,260
If I now reload my users we see the email is stored with a lowercase T at the beginning and without

45
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,060
that extra whitespace at the beginning and this is not simply the case because I sanitized the input

46
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:35,020
so sanitising data is all something which makes sense to ensure that your data is stored in a uniform

47
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,430
format and well that your email address is look equal and so on.
