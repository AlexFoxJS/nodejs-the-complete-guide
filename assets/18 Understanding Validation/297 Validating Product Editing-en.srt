1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:06,910
So let's now make sure that when we added a product we don't break our app as we're currently doing

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,210
it.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,040
If we enter something wrong but that we instead simply validate the input.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,190
Well we are validating it already because I do have all my validators added on the Edit product route

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,430
and the routes folder but any control or action that belongs to that we should also repeat the code

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,910
from adding a product.

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:31,630
So all that code where I fetched the arrows and then check for the existence of arrows we should grab

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,560
that and add it to post edit product as well.

9
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,110
And there before we start doing anything.

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:47,110
So before we find a product before we do that I will actually use my validation errors if we got any.

11
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:54,020
And then pre-rendered a page with the title of edit product editing set to true because we are still

12
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,030
in editing mode.

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:02,810
But has a are all set to True and the product data populated like this with the values the user entered.

14
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,960
And with that if we save that that's all we have to do because we're reusing the same view we use before.

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,260
So we already got everything we need for outputting the arrows.

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,780
And now if I do leave out that price field I get a title is not defined.

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,400
Yeah.

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,900
Here when I try to set the date on which I return here in this post edit product actions it's all named

19
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,520
updated title updated price.

20
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,730
So we should be using that.

21
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:39,010
So let's use updated title here updated prize updated image your L and down there it's update desk.

22
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,730
So this was all a mistake on my site.

23
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,170
These values which I extracted were named differently.

24
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:50,300
Now after renaming that if I try to submit this again now I simply get invalid value again.

25
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:56,460
You could override that default message in the way I showed it earlier in this module.

26
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,830
We all see that our image your L was lost.

27
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,290
Yeah but simply because I assigned to incorrectly I assigned the price to the image you are l and the

28
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,250
other way and the other way around.

29
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,320
We should of course do it this way.

30
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,130
And now if I update this now all the data is kept and I still get this error.

31
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,650
So now we get this validation in place too.

32
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:25,110
Now one thing we can do of course we can again set dead red border by repeating dat same way we did

33
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:32,640
in the log in or in the sign of pages we get our clocks here we conditionally add a C S S class and

34
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,580
we do the same and added product.

35
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,420
So therefore this input

36
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:48,340
I do at my class when there is an hour for to title input the same of course for the image you are l

37
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:54,320
and all the other inputs so that does not change here for the image you are el.

38
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,090
I do get to see us as Clauss here if we do have an error on the image you are el.

39
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,030
Let's do the same for the price of course.

40
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,840
Real quick.

41
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,190
Split up what we get thus far.

42
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,840
And let's here check the price to see whether we at this invalid see us as close to a text area it's

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,140
exactly the same.

44
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,490
We just need to do one little change to our C-s s code because here I'm checking for description and

45
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:31,110
Sodhi invalid class might be added to that text area thus far in my CSSA code in the forms see is as

46
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,750
follows.

47
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,800
I only add or change the text color if invalid was added to the input.

48
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,800
Now we should simply group a number of selectors at a number selector to that group.

49
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,480
And simply check whether in Validus added either to an input or two in text area.

50
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,880
And in both cases give it a red colored border and with that in place we now just have to make sure

51
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:00,910
that we pass these validation errors which we are checking and added product now that we passed that

52
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,430
with our responses.

53
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:09,660
So in the admin controller starting with get add product there are validation errors should be an empty

54
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:16,860
array because we got no validation Arison this place for a post at product However here we should have

55
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,530
validation errors which is equal to arus array.

56
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,450
So does Aeros which we did fetch for gueth edit product.

57
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:32,650
There again I will pass validation errors as an empty array because we have no errors here when we just

58
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,350
get the page.

59
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,230
But for a post edit product when we do return our error page basically then I want to set validation

60
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,650
arrows back to errors array like this.

61
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,510
And now we do pass that data.

62
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:57,510
So for now update here you see this is read only interesting pieces the title is read as well.

63
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:04,920
Well that makes sense because here I still have something in my validation set up in the routes folder

64
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,060
here alphanumeric.

65
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,930
We did remove dead if you remember because it should be is string otherwise to whitespace to blank is

66
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,190
not allowed.

67
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:21,530
So if I change that and I had update now I actually fail and do fail.

68
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,350
Because the cost to object id failed for that value.

69
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,520
Now what's wrong here.

70
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:36,510
Well keep in mind for editing we need that hidden input where I do have my product ID right.

71
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,050
And I do load that product ID when I first render this page.

72
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:50,280
But if I re rendered it due to a validation error or so due to this render function in my IF check here.

73
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,020
Well then I only said title image price and description.

74
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:03,010
I also need to set underscore ID though otherwise it will render the page.

75
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:08,320
But if I try to submit it that ID will be missing and I need that ID because I extract it here.

76
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:16,100
So what I should do is I should simply pass underscore ID here and set this equal to fraud ID which

77
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,420
I am extracting when this is submitted the first time.

78
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,440
So now I'm passing underscore ID.

79
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:32,470
And this means that if I now go to admen products editors and let's say I changed the price.

80
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,280
Works.

81
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,450
But now let's also do something that breaks validation.

82
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,800
So now this was reloaded due to our failing validation.

83
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:49,540
And now if I added this it will still work because now we all did store and re render that product ID

84
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,260
and that is how we can add validation and provide a relatively good user experience.
