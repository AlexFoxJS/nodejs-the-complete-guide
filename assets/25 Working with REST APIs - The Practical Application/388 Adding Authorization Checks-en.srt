00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:09,820
To check whether a user tries to edit or delete a post which does not belong to him we should go to

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,590
you on the note rest.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,850
AP I project we should go to our feet controller and there find are up they didn't delete Moffats of

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,480
course.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,080
Let's start with updating a post in there.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,700
We find a post by idea which is all right of course and we should keep in mind that for a post the Creator

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,420
will be the ID of the user who created that.

8
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:42,690
So even if we do ever post here we want to check whether that creator ID is equal to the ID of the currently

9
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,100
locked and user so Id ID that belongs to the token we received.

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:56,550
So here I'll check if Post creator is equal to the Creator to string to convert this to a string is

11
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,020
equal to request.

12
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:08,510
User ID so to the user id I got from my token if that is equal am allowed to continue if it is not equal

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,950
hence we need a exclamation mark here.

14
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,040
I'll throw in error so here I'll try it a you error.

15
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,170
Not all for just.

16
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:24,340
Set the status code to four hundred and three which is a good status code for offer isolation issues

17
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,400
and I'll throw that error.

18
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,230
Now if I saved that let's check that.

19
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,700
First of all let's delete a post which we are allowed to delete.

20
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,620
Like dead duck.

21
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:41,170
If I delete that now deleting obviously works because we never added any logic to prevent it.

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,780
Now let me log out and create a new user.

23
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,620
We need a different email address.

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,510
Well let's first of all try the same one.

25
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:53,720
It should fail so here all just use max and it fails.

26
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:00,160
Now let's use an used e-mail address and it succeeds.

27
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,660
Let's now log in with that newly created user.

28
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:09,340
Now let's try editing because that is where we did at protection the cup which was not created by that

29
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,100
user this failed with a 403 error.

30
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:22,970
Let's now log in with the user who did create it and let's now try editing with this user and this now

31
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,990
six seats.

32
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,980
So now we have this first check in place.

33
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,760
Let's now also added to our delete post logic there there.

34
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:38,560
I find my post at the beginning and before we continue here I basically want to implement that same

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,510
check.

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,160
I'll check the creator which is the ideal of the user and compare it to the user id extracted from the

37
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,530
toolkit and if they're not equal I will throw an error.

38
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:54,090
So now only offer us users should be able to delete the post of course.

39
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,640
Make sure to do that before you clear D-Mich..

40
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:02,600
Now after saving this let's go back and delete this and it succeeds because this was the right user.

41
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,680
Let's log out let's log in with this user let's say.

42
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,560
And create a new post doc

43
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:19,810
with the image and some content and let's log out and log in with the average user the user who did

44
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:25,750
not create it and let's delete that there and you see that fails.

45
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,690
No I didn't implement an error message there.

46
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,230
And of course you could also tweak the Front-End to not even showed these buttons if you're not allowed

47
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,070
to edit.

48
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,260
But my idea here is to show you how you can protect us on the back end.

49
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,320
Since of course this is a node course.

50
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:45,390
Therefore I deliberately let you do that so that you can see it that we can prevent this on the backend.

51
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,330
And indeed we can't delete this now.

52
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,400
With the wrong user.
