1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,000
We add that this is all middleware on the server.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:11,770
Let's now protect all feed routes with it not as super simple we just copy that middleware and we add

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:19,040
it to every route we have there as the first middleware before we do anything else because of no token

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,470
to stare.

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,810
We don't even need to continue with anything else.

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,970
Every route should be protected here.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:30,010
So we simply add this to every single route.

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:35,110
Now once you did add it to every route you have to make sure that you passed the token on the front

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,540
end.

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:42,040
So this headers set up where you add does offer a sation header.

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,340
This is something you now need to add in a couple of places in the front end.

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:55,890
For example our edit handler Stehr there on the fecche request we now should also add some headers and

13
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,100
the headers should contain are all for I sation token

14
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,770
if we scroll down further we also got the lead post handler.

15
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:12,680
Well there obviously we also want to add some headers and that one had or we want to add is our offer

16
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:18,420
sation token of course we can all the fecche single posts.

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:25,030
So in this single post js file in the front end code where we fetch a single post we all want to pass

18
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:31,330
that second argument to fetch add our headers and there at the all right sation header.

19
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:35,210
Now we should be able to navigate around as long as we are authentic hate it.

20
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:41,190
But I also want to lock down access to ensure that I can only added and delete posts which actually

21
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,090
create it.

22
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,430
Now in the last lecture I deleted all posts.

23
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,890
So let's make sure that we first of all connect posts and users when we create new posts.
