1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:09,120
So it's time to dive deeper into your recipe eyes and build a complete project or a complete back and

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,710
forth project as arrest API.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,770
And in this project we'll have a look at things like authentication and other interesting things like

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,450
image upload and so on.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,810
So what's in this module in detail will plan our rest of your eye or I'll show you a project for which

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,310
you will need want and will then build it together of course.

7
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,800
So in detail we will implement all the corrupt operations our project needs.

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,870
So creating reading updating and deleting items in a database and so on.

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,950
That is what we'll do here will define all the rest API endpoints for days and so on will add validation

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,280
on the server side to make sure that only valid data gets stored in our database.

11
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,660
We'll add image upload so that we still can store images even though we're not rendering views anymore.

12
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:06,700
And finally all dive into off indication which will be very important and very interesting too.

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,060
So let's dive in.
