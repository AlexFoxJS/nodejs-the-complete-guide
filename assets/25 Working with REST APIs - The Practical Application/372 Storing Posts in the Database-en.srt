1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,340
Well speaking of that let's now use that model.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,850
We're exporting it here.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,530
Let's now use it in the feed controller.

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,430
There we first of all need to import it.

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:20,060
So you're all import posed by requiring it from my models folder from the post file.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:27,820
And now we can use that post model in create post after we validate the input here.

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:33,810
There I will create a new post with my post more as a constructor.

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:40,890
We pass a javascript object and there we define basically what we do down there so we can cut that and

9
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,210
move it up here.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,730
I don't need to set created at because mongooses will do that for me.

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,960
Thanks to that timestamps option we set here.

12
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:55,440
And of course I don't need to set underscore ID because mongooses will create that for me as well.

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,750
Thailand can't that should be passed and the creator as well for the moment.

14
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:05,780
So now you'll learn that we can't just call safe on the model to save it to the database.

15
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:12,830
And this will give us a promise or promise like object where we can catch any errors.

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,840
And here I will lock the arrow for now.

17
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:24,910
Will later add real error handling of course and I get a result which I also want to log here.

18
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:35,820
And I will also send my response whips in here and the then block I'll send the response to 101 is to

19
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,070
stay this code.

20
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,440
The post op check here however will be the result object.

21
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,030
I get back here because that should be my created post.

22
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:51,120
If we now save that server side code and we go back to our front application we should need to change

23
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,740
anything in our re-act code.

24
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,720
Instead we can't just try this.

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,140
Does does work.

26
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,010
Let's use an image upload.

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,860
Still does not work we'll do this later checking it.

28
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,540
And this seems to fail.

29
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,860
If we go back I see parve image Eurail is required.

30
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:21,670
Which makes sense because in my model I set image yourself as a required property.

31
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,480
So my field controller when I create a new post I should also add the image you are all here.

32
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,040
And for an hour that can point to images doc JPAC will later add file upload.

33
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:39,690
As I mentioned so my mistake we should add this on the server side make sure we store an image yourself

34
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,490
so that we meet the requirements of our model.

35
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,280
And now let's try this again.

36
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,480
Does that work.

37
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,880
Take the doc Andrews some conta except this looks good.

38
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,610
Post created successfully.

39
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,270
And there we see indeed.

40
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,750
This is the data or the post which was stored with the Creator the content does automatically generated

41
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:11,590
created at and updated at timestep thanks to the time stamps option ante automatically generated ID.

42
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,770
So that is working.

43
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,120
And on the server side also get no error.

44
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,080
I only see that created object being printed.

45
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,880
Thanks to Kohn's a look.

46
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,720
So that is working fine.

47
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:28,790
Now isn't next step we can work on serving that image and on except that image uploads and on handling

48
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,700
dead error.
