1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:11,230
Before we start working on the project let me quickly have a look at rest your eyes and the over knowledge

2
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:17,410
you gained from the course is that now all redundant we learn about things like setting up our node

3
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:25,480
and express app routing handling requests responses request validation database communication file handling

4
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,410
uploads downloads sessions and cookies and often dictation.

5
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,790
These are some big topics we covered for the course.

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,300
Now how do we have to adjust our knowledge.

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,480
Now did we build a restful API instead of a view based application.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,330
Well regarding the general setup we already saw that in the last module there are no changes we need

9
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:49,870
to do.

10
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,370
We still set up our normal node and express server regarding the routing.

11
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,490
We also have no significant changes.

12
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,610
We just use more HTP methods more HTB works now.

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,320
That's the only difference in the end for handling requests and responses.

14
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,700
You already learned that.

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,820
Now we work with Jason data instead of the use.

16
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,920
So that is a difference we render no use anymore.

17
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:21,150
We have no use Folder anymore we don't use Ejay as handlebars or anything like that.

18
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,310
Instead we only exchange data so there is a change.

19
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,300
But as you learned in the last module This is also not too hard to implement.

20
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:35,970
Now if you want to add validation for incoming request data then we will not have to change anything.

21
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:42,640
We still can add validation for example with Express validator which we used in the validation module

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,890
of this course and the way we use it and the logic behind it does not change a single bit.

23
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,750
Database communication.

24
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:57,120
So working with database B that a sequel or no sequel database also does not change.

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:04,420
This happens on the server side in controller action typically and the logic we write dare the code

26
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:11,290
we write there is not affected by the data we exchange or by the fact whether we render a view or if

27
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:17,310
we send around Jason data when we talk about file uploads downloads and so on.

28
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,110
There's also not much to change.

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,940
On the service side nothing changes actually on the client side.

30
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,320
The logic changes a little bit and I will show you how we can implement file upload and of course also

31
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,160
serving files in this module.

32
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:40,900
Now for sessions and cookies there we have changes because we will not use sessions and cookies anymore

33
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,980
with rest.

34
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:48,790
API eyes are the reason for that simply is that you learned about these restful principles or rest API

35
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:55,200
principles and one of them was that each request is treated separately.

36
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:02,610
It is looked at independently from previous requests so we have no connection between the client and

37
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,230
server.

38
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,790
We have no shared connection history to be precise and therefore we managed no sessions on the server

39
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:17,340
because the rest API does not care about the clients or whether that client connected to the API before

40
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,730
and therefore authentication will also have to change.

41
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:26,110
We'll use a different authentication approach and I'll show you which approach does this and how to

42
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,730
implement it in this module too.

43
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,320
So overall there are not too many changes.

44
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,310
Some changes.

45
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,710
The biggest changes are related to sessions and they are for authentication and I will show you how

46
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:44,500
to implement them but the rest will still work the same you learn that and for all the knowledge you

47
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,290
gained from the Course is of course everything but redundant.

48
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,950
It's still super important.

49
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,070
And with that let's dive in.

50
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,710
Let's see which project will be working on and how we can work on it.
