1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:08,870
Now talking about deleting there's one more thing we should do in case we do succeed we should clear

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,830
the relation of posts and users.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,880
If we refreshed the post collection we only have one item there.

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:21,040
But if I have a look at my users they're now the first user has a couple of posts.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,290
And the second user has so to because right now we have no logic to clear posts.

6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,460
When I lead them to clear relations and we should of course do that.

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:38,470
Now how can we get rid of a relation Well we delete the post anyways so there's nothing we need to do

8
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,960
there.

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:46,600
But on the user we need to pull our reference to do that we should find to user after we deleted a post

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,360
let's say so here or find a user by ID and I can use my request.

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,510
User ID here.

12
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,440
And I will return as user object in there.

13
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,920
Well let's grab that code and add a number.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,810
Then block where I will have that user mongoose model fetched from my database.

15
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,090
Now in there.

16
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:15,500
I will use my user model and there the posts array and then there is a pull method mongooses gives me

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,960
there I need to past the idea of the post I want to remove.

18
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:26,780
Now I deleted the post already here but the post idea is still available of course so I can pass post

19
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,210
ID here.

20
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:35,540
Now I can call safe here to save that updated user and return that grab the response one more time and

21
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,470
add another.

22
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,010
Then block with the result of that operation.

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,470
And here I'm done with clearing the relation.

24
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,040
Now to see that in action.

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,830
Let me actually get rid of all users manually by using Mangu to be calm pass.

26
00:01:50,850 --> 00:02:00,200
Also get rid of all posts and log out here and let's create a brand new user because we cleared all

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,710
users

28
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,520
like this.

29
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:17,570
Let's log in with that user and let's create a new post a duck used at DAQ image it Dexron for sure

30
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,310
except.

31
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,450
And before we do anything let's go back to Mungo's add to monkey be compas I mean there we can see that

32
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,320
this post has this creator and this user.

33
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,140
More importantly has this post in his posts erased.

34
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,230
Now I'm locked in with the right user Let's click delete.

35
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,790
This worked and now if I refresh posts we got no posts in there because I deleted the only post we had

36
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,630
and then users desir is now also empty.

37
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,160
So now we're clearing this as well.
