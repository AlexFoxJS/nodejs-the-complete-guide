1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,800
In the last module you learn how to use sequel in a no chess application.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,620
And we did this at the example for my sequel database which we want to use to store data.

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:21,050
Now we didn't complete the project with that sequel approach simply because this module will now implement

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,220
features like for example working with the shopping cart with the help of sequela eyes.

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,650
This will still use the sequel database still used to same.

6
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:38,240
My sequel database actually behind the scenes or in the background as a database but the code we write

7
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,200
will be different.

8
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:46,760
Instead of sequel statements as we have them here and as we wrote them in the last module we'll use

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:54,410
a third party package that allows us to work with javascript objects and convenient methods to create

10
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,720
new elements in the database to edit them to delete them or to find them and also to connect them.

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,570
Because you remember a sequel database typically also works with relations.

12
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,040
And we got non-golf to use in our current project.

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,410
So this is what we'll dive into in this module.

14
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,820
You'll learn what exactly sequela eyes.

15
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:21,170
This third party package is and how you can use it and will then implement our products and our card

16
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,530
and so on in this module with equalize.
