1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,470
We don't just have products and users.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,980
We all have the cart and we haven't worked on the card for quite some time now from a relation or association

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,100
perspective.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:21,460
A card should belong to a user and a card that in turn simply holds products many products with a quantity

5
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,500
associated to them.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,800
So actually will need more than one model.

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,310
I can already tell you that.

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,740
But let's work on the card model first.

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:35,590
I delete everything here and start writing it from scratch.

10
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,710
First of all imports sequel lies by requiring the sequel lies package.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,150
And of course then I will also import sequel eyes from my database file.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,730
So from utl database like this and then it's time to create the card model with sequela is to fine as

13
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,290
we did it before.

14
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:04,470
Name ID card and a card for me here simply has an ID and that id will be of type.

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:14,130
Sequel lies string autoincrement should be true allow null should be false and the primary key will

16
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,240
be true.

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,490
And then I will export this.

18
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:24,900
Now you might be wondering where are the products well we have to keep in mind that a card should belong

19
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,570
to a single user but may hold multiple products.

20
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,810
The carts table however should hold the different cards for different users so will not just need to

21
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,900
cartes table and model will also need a new card.

22
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,260
Item j.

23
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,090
Yes file in there.

24
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,660
I will also again I'll copy a code from cards to define a new model.

25
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:00,630
I'll call it carte item though an export card item here and I'll name it card item here.

26
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:09,190
When I did find a model the name it does will all have an ID but then also a quantity and that quantity

27
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:18,150
will be an integer because each card item is essentially a combination of a product and the ideal of

28
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,840
the card in which this product lies and the quantity.

29
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,700
Now the idea of the card to which does this relate to doesn't have to be added by us here because we

30
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:33,900
will again create an association and let sequel's managed this so it's time for some associations then

31
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:44,610
let's go to the app js file your and in there time to add more associations besides product and user

32
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:54,710
for example a user has one cart and for this to work we need to import the cart.

33
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:02,020
So let's scroll up to the imports and let's also import Cartier from the cart file.

34
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:07,370
We all need to cart item so import cart item from the cart.

35
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,130
Item.

36
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,290
Following the models folder.

37
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,440
So these two new ports have to be added and wisdom at it.

38
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:20,820
If we go down again let's go back to find their relations a user has one cart and a cart on the other

39
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,330
hand belongs to a user.

40
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,810
So this is basically in a world of this relation and it's optional.

41
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,950
You don't need to add it.

42
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,530
One Direction is enough.

43
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:39,590
This set up you're either of the two approaches will add key to Descartes and you field to cart which

44
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,050
is the user id to which the card belongs.

45
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:55,460
Next I will add my card here and say that this card belongs to many products and on the other hand a

46
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:05,410
product belongs to many carts some many to many relationship because one card can hold multiple products

47
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,080
and a single product can be part of multiple different cards.

48
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,640
This only works with an intermediates table that connects them which basically stores a combination

49
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,610
of product IDs and card IDs.

50
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,450
And for that I actually had my card item model.

51
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,600
I had a second argument to belongs to many.

52
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,740
And there we at the fruit keep telling sequels where these connections should be stored and that is

53
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:36,820
my card item model so I'll add that to both belongs to many calls here.

54
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:45,640
So now we got this set up here and therefore now we should have all the setup we need if we now again

55
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:53,780
temporarily set forest to true to ensure that we do recreate all tables as required and we go back to

56
00:04:53,780 --> 00:05:02,670
the work bench and refresh all we actually only see two tables because we have an error here.

57
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,910
We scroll up a bit we see incorrect column specifier for column ID.

58
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:14,080
So something went wrong here when C-Class tried to create our tables because it looks like we got some

59
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,510
error in one of our models.

60
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:25,760
And the thing is the idea here in card item that should be an editor not a string same in card should

61
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,370
be an integer not a string.

62
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,010
Now this is looking much better.

63
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,520
And now if you go back and refresh all now we see carts and cart items here.

64
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:42,800
And we can see that in carts we only got Id created and they did that and the user id to which the cart

65
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:50,420
belongs in users we don't care about that we only have to user information and in card items we have

66
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:56,120
a combination of the cart ID too which does card item belongs and the Product ID.

67
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:01,430
So now we get everything we need to manage our card items for the cards we need.
