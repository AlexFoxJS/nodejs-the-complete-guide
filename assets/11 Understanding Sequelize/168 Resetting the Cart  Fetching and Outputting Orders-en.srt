1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,210
Knouted we can add orders.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,470
One thing is missing and that is that we cleared the cart.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,660
I want to do this right after we edit the orders.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:17,050
So down there I need to work with the cart and Daffer First of all all store it in a new variable fetched

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,040
cart.

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,590
Initially it's empty.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,230
And here once I got the cart I'll store the cart in the fetched cart variable so that I can also use

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,990
it down there.

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:38,020
Now that cart should essentially drop all its cart items now I can use my fetch car to your to call

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:46,030
and effets set products for this cart and set the products to knol.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,980
Now let's return this and then add a new then block with the result of this operation where I simply

12
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,140
want to redirect.

13
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,750
Let's give it a try let's save this and reload the card page here click order.

14
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,500
Now we're on the warder's page.

15
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:07,430
Go back to the cart and we got no products in the cart because if we go into the workbench we see that

16
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:14,180
the card items indeed are empty because we dropped all the items in a card by setting them to null.

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,190
This is how easy we can clean up the card here.

18
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,000
So with that we got all that logic done.

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,590
The last step I want to do here is that I actually show my orders and we can't get rid of the check

20
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,680
out page here for now because we have no such step at the moment.

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:37,490
So now let's make sure we all retrieve to orders correctly and can display them on our orders page for

22
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:37,990
this year.

23
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,480
All First of all get my user.

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,300
And now I'm interested in the orders of this user which I can get with get orders.

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,560
A magic method added by sequel's.

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:56,580
Thanks to our associations here we again get a promise that's Lague any potential errors we get.

27
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,690
And then the then lock I know that I have my orders.

28
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,330
This is where I want to render my orders page of therefore and I will pass a new variable into that

29
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,060
page.

30
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:16,110
The order is variable which simply stores all the retrieved orders so that I got my orders for it as

31
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,010
user.

32
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,050
Now let's go to the respective view and the views folder.

33
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,730
Here's the orders is it just fall which always shows nothing there.

34
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:33,000
Now obviously that's not what I always want to show it's that I only want to show nothing there or no

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,290
orders placed yet.

36
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,370
Whatever you like.

37
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,040
If we got no orders.

38
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:46,820
So first of all at a normal Ejaz statement where a check if orders length is smaller or equal than Sered

39
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,650
then we probably have no orders.

40
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:55,260
So in this case I want to display nothing there.

41
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,000
Now else and that is of course an important part.

42
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,750
Let's also close that statement of course with the closing curly brace.

43
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,790
Else I want to output borders and for now I'll do this in a very Oggy way with an ordered list of list

44
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,840
items which I repeat for every order.

45
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:23,960
So again Ejaz time to loop through all orders with for each for example now for each.

46
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:29,270
As you know takes a non-dysfunctional which gives us access to every order.

47
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:36,500
Then we repeat this code here for every order and then here we close to Kerley raise and the Purab record

48
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,980
of our For each method we can add a semi-colon if you want.

49
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,170
And now this is executed for every order we got.

50
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,030
Now every order we got has a couple of products that belong to the order.

51
00:03:50,100 --> 00:04:01,120
So for every order I haveour I will output age 1 tech with ID ordered thought Id output like this and

52
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:07,130
below that number nested an ordered list with more list items where a loop through the products belong

53
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,350
to that order.

54
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,130
So here I'll have order and then its order item.

55
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:26,390
That is our connected model so to say for each cost that will be a list of all their related items.

56
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,280
And here I get my item.

57
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:41,580
Let's close this here and lets all the clothes De for each syntax then down there.

58
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,820
And now this list item is repeated for every item and in this order and there I simply want to output

59
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,770
the title so output item title.

60
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:01,770
Keep in mind this is a product so it will have a title and then maybe in normal parentheses I'll output

61
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,890
item quantity and this will not work.

62
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:15,490
I can already tell you that I save that I get another error actually.

63
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,380
And that assembly is simply coming from the fact that I a lead that one route to check out out.

64
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,840
We need to the leaders here too.

65
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,570
So I believe that the action would be to delete route too.

66
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:31,430
But still if I reload the orders page now this will just crash here because I have a Ejay as syntax

67
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,350
error though.

68
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,980
Let's quickly fix that.

69
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,930
OK here for item quantity you need to close that.

70
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:47,390
But even after this change this will not work now because order is not defined because that should be

71
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:58,960
orders for each but now because we can't loop through order item here this does not work.

72
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:08,220
And to understand this let's have a look at our shop as controller file and let's outport order is here

73
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:13,080
and let's see what exactly we get protists Let's now reload the page.

74
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,410
It will still break of course but now we can have a look at the output there.

75
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:26,410
Want to scroll up there is what we lock with this line Kohn's lock orders and there we can see that

76
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,630
we do have an array of orders but an order does not have an order item key.

77
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,310
This is not provided by sequel eyes.

78
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:46,940
If we all want to fetch their related products to an order we have to pass an object here where we set

79
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:54,110
include to an array with the field products or the element products as a string.

80
00:06:54,110 --> 00:07:04,230
Now why products because an aperture as we associate order to many product products of course.

81
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:11,990
And if we look at our model the product model has been named product sequel eyes pluralize estus and

82
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:17,460
then we can use a concept called eager loading where we basically instruct sequel eyes.

83
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:23,300
Hey if you are fetching all the orders please old affectional related products already and give me back

84
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,760
one array of orders.

85
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,160
That also includes the products per order.

86
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:34,240
Now this only works of course because we do have a relation between orders and products as set up at

87
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,310
App G-S here and now we can load both together.

88
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,900
This will still not make our template will really be deadly.

89
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,500
But now we got orders with more data in them.

90
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:51,200
Each order will now have a product array and with that in mind we can go back to our view here to the

91
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:58,010
orders view and tweak that we can love Fruita orders and every order will have an ID that's fine.

92
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:05,020
Now our order will still not have a order item but it will have a products list and now we can look

93
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:11,450
for all the products and each item which is now simply a product and therefore we can name it as such.

94
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:18,620
To make this clear each product of course has a title which we can output and it does not have a quantity

95
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:26,460
but the product will now have an order item key which then stores the quantity for that product.

96
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:36,910
In that order and now if we reload this page we do see our orders with the nested products in there.

97
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:42,140
Not the most beautiful presentation you have for sure but this is how it actually works.

98
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,480
We also see there is one Dhami order that was created accidentally in between with no products and we

99
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,540
can always verify that by looking into the database we get for order items related to orderless with

100
00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:02,420
the ID 9 and 11 in the orders we got 9 10 and 11 so indeed there is the order with the ID 10 which has

101
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,520
no items.

102
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,080
We can simply clear it.

103
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,870
Right clicking on it here.

104
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,270
Delete row.

105
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:16,000
Apply apply and close and now if you reload the orders page it's gone and we only see these two orders.

106
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,680
So this is now working and now we get the full flow.

107
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,250
We got a user who is related to created products we can edit the products we can delete the products

108
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,990
we can add products to the cart.

109
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,230
We can then also create the order based on the data in our cart.

110
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,760
We can view product details and so on.

111
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,770
So this is all working fine as it should.

112
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,920
And with that we get the set up we need for now.

113
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,440
This gave you an introduction to see equalize and definitely dive into the official box to play around

114
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,420
with that and learn more about it and how it works.
