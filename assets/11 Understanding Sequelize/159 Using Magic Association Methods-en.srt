1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:08,580
From now on all new products that are created should be associated to the currently locked end user.

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:15,460
For now this will only be this one dummy user that means that if I'm in the admin chase controller here

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:21,090
when we create a new product in post ad product will not create the product like this anymore.

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:29,110
We need to pass an extra information regarding our user that is associated one way of doing this is

5
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:37,030
did we set this new user ID field we got keep in mind user ID was added as a database field because

6
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:43,190
we now have a relation set up and we said this to request user ID.

7
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:48,970
Keep in mind that request user is just sequel's user object which holds both the database data for that

8
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,660
user as well as the helper methods.

9
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,120
So this should create new products with that user being associated to it.

10
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:03,840
Let's test this let's go back to ad product and simply enter some dummy values here for now.

11
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,430
Seems to work we get no error here.

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,600
And if we look into our products table by clicking on this I can hear we indeed have the user ID stored

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
here.

14
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:24,820
Now we also have one tiny problem or thing we can improve at least we manually fetched the user id and

15
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:30,530
this is not a lot of work here but there is a more elegant way of setting this so that we don't manually

16
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,240
have to set to use right.

17
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:40,250
We can use an oracle feature of sequel's we can use our user object as it's stored in the request and

18
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,790
always keep in mind this is a sequel as object with all the magic features and there will actually have

19
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,030
a create product method.

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,650
Now where is that coming from.

21
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:57,590
Well it is something you can get from the official docs if you read Frwy associations there you'll learn

22
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:04,830
that if you set up associations sequel add special Moffats depending on the association yet.

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:12,440
And for a belongs to has many Association as we did sequel lies ads methods that allow us for example

24
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,820
to create a new Associated object.

25
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:23,030
So since a user has many products or a product belongs to a user.

26
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:32,220
As we learned or as we set it up an aperture Yes since we have that relation to find sequels automatically

27
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:40,020
as a create product method to the user create product because our model is named product and create

28
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,280
and automatically add it at the beginning of the method name.

29
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,590
That is some magic done by sequel.

30
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,850
So create product is available and there we simply pass in the object with the product data that can't

31
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,500
be inferred by sequel.

32
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:02,940
So basically anything but user ID and timestamps and then we can chain are then and catch block here

33
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,850
just as we did it before.

34
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,270
The rest doesn't change but this not automatically creates a connected model.

35
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:19,130
So if I now save this and add a new product this still works and if we have a look at our database and

36
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:25,220
we refresh the products table here we see we also get to user ID here even though we did not set it

37
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,420
explicitly.

38
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:33,680
Now this is done by sequel lies with this magic way of connecting it and that is a really cool way of

39
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:40,020
using associations in sequel eyes and making sure that our models know about each other.
