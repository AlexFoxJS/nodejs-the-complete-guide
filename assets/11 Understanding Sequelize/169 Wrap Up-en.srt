1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:10,500
That's it for the sequel part of this course you learn about sequel dad it's a database philosophy or

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:19,350
schema engine type that uses strict data schemas and relations in the databases that use sequel and

3
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:27,840
that you can easily connect to such databases with no chips with packages like my sequel to there we

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,600
had to write all the sequel queries manually though.

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,000
And you also have to configure the database manually add tables manually set up relations and that is

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,880
a lot of work and definitely something you need to learn.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,230
In addition to no chance it's its own language essentially.

8
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:50,100
Or you use packages like sequels sequels allows you to not write sequel queries but instead interact

9
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:58,020
with your database through models you define and not just models but also relations so-called associations

10
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,670
in the sequels world.

11
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,850
That gives you a lot of magic methods that allow you to easily connect data add data delete data.

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,320
Basically what you saw in this module.

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,200
Now you could easily create an entire course just about sequel and sequels.

14
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,500
And that is not what this courses its the complete Noad course up to complete sequel.

15
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:24,780
Course I strongly encourage you to dive into this sequel docs if you plan on continuing with that to

16
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:31,650
learn all the ins and outs of this package and simply play around with it build your own demo applications

17
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,760
and try out the different features different types of relations and so on.

18
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:44,310
All move on here and learn about a different way of storing data with a no sequel approach in long OTB.

19
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,250
This is what will dive into in the next modules.
