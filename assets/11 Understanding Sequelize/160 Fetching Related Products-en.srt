1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,880
We learn about associations and that we get these cool magic methods you're about which you can learn

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,480
more in the official docs of course.

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,860
Now which implication status have for our Ivor Edmund Jr's actions.

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:20,690
Well get that product there's no implication we fetch a single product year and we can do this of before

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,940
we don't really care about the user here.

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:29,240
You could argue that you only want to find products for the currently locked and user though then what

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:37,370
you actually want to do is you want to use request user get products

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:49,340
and there to find where ID equals Pre-OT ID to also have that folder and then you can change your normal

9
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:57,380
then call and so on with that if you click on edit we see an empty form because it generally did work

10
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:03,050
and we see the sequel statement here where it simply looks for a product with the user id D1 and that

11
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,700
is not the condition we wrote were responsible for this part where it then also never stolen the product

12
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,910
ID but user ID 1 was added by sequel eyes because we used get products on the user.

13
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,780
But keep in mind here we get back in array even if it only holds one element.

14
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:25,790
So if we got products and therefore we know that one product the one we are interested in will always

15
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,410
be the first element.

16
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,670
So we have to store that separately in the new content.

17
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,650
And now if we reload this this works.

18
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,580
So this is a more elegant way though we could also still only use the ID if we want to use the old approach

19
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,420
if we move on for a post editing a product there.

20
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,530
I'm fine with finding a product like this because if we are at this point I assume we already have a

21
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,130
product for this user only.

22
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,280
So if I updated like this it's fine.

23
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:02,680
Now get product should change instead of finding all products I want to find price for this user.

24
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,800
So a call get products like dat which will give me all products for this user.

25
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,220
And then I can render them here.

26
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:17,080
So for now I'll go to admen products I see the products for days user here because this select statement

27
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:24,200
gets executed where we narrow down the user to the user with the ID 1 and post delete product.

28
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,140
Here again we could only find a product for it as user with this ID.

29
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,170
I'm fine with this setup though.

30
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,450
So some tiny changes showing you more of that power.

31
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,970
Sequel lives gives you four associated models.

32
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,540
Let's next have a look at how we can reintroduce the cart to our application.
