1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:09,070
Our program is taking shape we can't delete products from the cart yet though so we should definitely

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,310
all to do that.

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,160
To do that we still need product ID.

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,540
We want to delete.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:24,460
But now again I will first of all get my card for a user by accessing a request user get carte and then

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:29,370
adding then and catch calls as we did at multiple times already.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,940
And then block here.

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:41,510
I know that I've got access to my cart and in that cart I now want to find the products for this user

9
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,030
and to be precise the products.

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,230
Not all products but the product with that product ID.

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:01:01,990
So here I will return cart get products and then simply here where ID is equal to fraud ID in the next

12
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:11,250
block we at identify or have my products and I have to extract that exact product I'm looking for as

13
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,650
the first element in the product array.

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,270
And now I want to destroy that product but not in the products table of course but only in that in-between

15
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:27,330
cart item table that connects my cart with that product to do that.

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:36,450
I can simply call product card item using that magic field sequel I gives me to access the element in

17
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,940
the in between table and then destroy.

18
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,650
And that will remove it from that in-between table.

19
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,690
Nobbled return this so that I can add a number then block here with the result of the zipper operation

20
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,840
if I would care.

21
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:58,260
And then there I'll simply redirect back to the cart where I should then not see that product anymore.

22
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,190
Let's give it a try.

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,670
If we reload the cards and isolate that one with quantity free it's gone.

24
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,950
Got no arrows here.

25
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:12,240
And if we reload the card items we only have one element in there with quantity 2 and the other one

26
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,210
is gone indeed.

27
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,160
So this is how simple we can delete connected items in this in-between table.

28
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,140
Here at the example of the card.
