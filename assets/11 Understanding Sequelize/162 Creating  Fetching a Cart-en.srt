1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:08,420
To work with our new cart Let's go to the control us folder here and there to shop chairs fall which

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:16,580
is where we have our cart related actions get products get product get index debtors all working get

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,980
card however will not work.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:31,510
In their I want to use a card associated with my existing user to get all the products in it and render

5
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,120
them to the screen.

6
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:41,620
For this let's get rid of that code but I'll comment it out so that I easily can use my render function

7
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,240
again.

8
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:50,060
Let's use request user that's still a user stored in our request by the way one important adjustment.

9
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:57,150
Let's disable that force sinking again so that we don't always override any data we stored.

10
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:02,870
So let's go back to happen chase at a as excuse me and let's use the user we retrieve for every new

11
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,070
request and which we stored in the request and there.

12
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:14,130
Let's execute cart and let's look into this and see if this gives us anything meaningful.

13
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:21,690
Finale's safeness and I go to cart it doesn't load the page.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,900
And if I go back we see on the find here.

15
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,130
So we can't access to cards like this.

16
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:34,970
But what we can do here is we can use our request user and get the card which is associated to it looks

17
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,440
at them and catch

18
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,300
here will get to the card and let's lock the card here.

19
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:53,070
We save that and reload this page and still will not load.

20
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,010
But now I get Knol here and not on the find.

21
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02,270
Now the reason why we don't find anything here for either of the two approaches is that we got no cards

22
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,760
yet.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,720
If we look into our database cards it's totally empty just as we create a user right at startup.

24
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,740
Alternate a card for dead user so here I create a user.

25
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:23,490
Now in the next or get dead user I will also create a cart by adding user create cart like this.

26
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,390
And I don't need to pass any data in that because a card in the beginning will will not hold any special

27
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,930
data it just needs to be there.

28
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,290
I'll then return this and only listen in the next step.

29
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,550
Where I get my card.

30
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:53,140
So to say and with this now set up you see insert into cards call is done here we now have a look into

31
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,110
our hearts.

32
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:02,250
We see now we get a card associated You are a user with the ID 1 and now if I tried to reload that card's

33
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:13,230
page again here we now get some output and this output is stemming from our Get card call here.

34
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,120
So disconsolate Guerrera you looked at card.

35
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,630
So now it is working now for completeness sake.

36
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,910
Let's also console log request user card.

37
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,370
Again that's does all the work.

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,290
If a reload year does still it's the old log.

39
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,590
But if I scroll above it we still see on the find.

40
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:44,170
So this does not work we can't access card as property here but we can call get cards to work with the

41
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,570
card.

42
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,630
So now we've got the cart a way that will we loaded the card from the database.

43
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,680
We know more about that card here with the card away label.

44
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,320
We can use it to fetch the products that are inside of it by returning cards get products.

45
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:11,220
Remember a card is associated to products in a rapturous fall through belongs to Manny and sequel lies

46
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,710
will do the magic of looking into card item and so on.

47
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,900
So into this.

48
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:24,270
In between table so we can get products was added by sequel lies as a magic method.

49
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,780
And therefore here in this then block will have products available.

50
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,230
And here again just like any error I get.

51
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:40,720
But then block here we should have the products that are in this cart and that of course means that

52
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,750
we can now render these products.

53
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,520
So here I will render

54
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,620
my products here.

55
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,250
Store them in products and pass them to to you.

56
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,190
Now this will not work as expected though.

57
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,050
If I now reload this page we see no products in CART.

58
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:06,850
Now we got no products in a cart but we'll see that later once we do have them it'll all not work but

59
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,230
I'll come back yet.

60
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,090
For now let's just have a look at our Querrey statement.

61
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,990
We can see the disaster statement executed by sequel ice.

62
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,910
And if you didn't see it before here we can definitely see the advantage we have by using a package

63
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,690
like this.

64
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,490
We don't have to write that sequel Saipan on our own.

65
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,560
We use sequel eyes and let it do that behind the scenes.

66
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:35,440
So before we come back to what we will have to do regarding getting the card products lets make sure

67
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,630
we can add process to the card.

68
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:44,380
So for now I'll get rid of all that logic here and I will focus on adding products to the card in the

69
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,070
next step.
