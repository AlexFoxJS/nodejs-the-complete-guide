1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,420
Updating was successful.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,280
Now let's also make sure we can delete products.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,640
So in adman's Yes I'm talking about the postal product method here.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:17,380
Now we get the product that you would just get it now delete by it does not exist in a sequel sized

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:27,400
world instead on the product we can call destroy and destroy allows us to destroy any product we find

6
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,550
through our options here.

7
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:34,300
And these options allow us to for example add a WHERE condition to narrow down which product to delete

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,040
can also use a different approach.

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:43,120
Instead of calling destroy like disks and adding a condition which product to find which is of course

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,940
fine.

11
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,730
We can also use FINE BY idea again to find a product by that idea.

12
00:00:49,630 --> 00:01:00,220
And then again have our well known then and error catch methods and then we know we got a product in

13
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,420
on that product.

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,760
We can also call destroy.

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,530
And now this will destroy the found product we can return this because this will also yield a promise

16
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:17,990
and they offer add and Navier then block which will execute once the distractions exceed it and there

17
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:28,500
we can if we want console log destroyed product and we can also redirect thereafter.

18
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:35,240
We should redirect here to make sure we only redirect once the deletions and see that if we now go back

19
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,830
to our application and I add a new Dammy product without any picture just like this and we get to admin

20
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:43,600
products.

21
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,900
I got stuck on loading this automatically I'll look into this a second.

22
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:52,820
But if we go to Aben prox manual we see it here for click delete this works.

23
00:01:52,820 --> 00:02:00,690
Now one thing I noticed is that if I added a product here we get Stec and we don't redirect.

24
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:08,330
So for adding a product host add product here we don't do anything in then block there we should of

25
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:13,250
course all the redirect slash admin slash product.

26
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,850
So basically the same we redirect when deleting.

27
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,110
So now every go back

28
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:32,090
and we add a new product again this is working and now we can also delete the products here.

29
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,480
So this is now all working and how we can manage products.

30
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,980
We can do them here.

31
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:42,670
Now one thing we haven't touched at all our relations though because we don't just have products we

32
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,230
all have a card and eventually we'll also have users.
