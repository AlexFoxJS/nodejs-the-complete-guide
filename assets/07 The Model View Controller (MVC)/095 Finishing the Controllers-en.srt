00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,430
We added our products controller in the last lecture.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,900
Now let's also make sure we handle the 4 0 4 route with a controller.

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,540
In theory does this of course is not required totally optional but it's a good practice.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,920
So definitely possed a video here and try this on your own before we then do that together.

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,360
Make sure to decide which controller you want to use a new one or the existing products controller and

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,170
how you would extract you for 0 4.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:36,180
Here is the 404 page logic into that controller and connect the existing route to it.

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,860
Good luck.

9
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,570
Where are you.

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,820
Successful.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,170
Let's try that out and for that let's first of all identify where we are rendering that 4 0 4 route

12
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,780
and that is the various file here at the bottom.

13
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,420
Now we can absolutely leave that code here.

14
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:00,790
It's very simple and there's nothing wrong with it but to be inline with our average code is that when

15
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:06,800
I put that into a controller now it's clearly not related to products because we can have many features

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,990
on our page and every path can fail or the user can enter any random path.

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,550
So instead I'll create a new controller here.

18
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,850
And you can name as however you want.

19
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,590
You can name it for 0 4.

20
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,350
J.S. I'll name it.

21
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:29,480
Rr DOT J.S. and in there I will export a function with exports and then I'll name it get 4 or 4 a page

22
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:37,280
or you get 4 or 4 to be in line with get products which I have in our controller and now it will cat

23
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,600
dead function here.

24
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,530
This middleware function from actually yes an error.

25
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:48,030
J.S. this is what I will store here and get 404.

26
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,130
This is my function where I returned the four or a page.

27
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,220
And with this I just have to go back to actually yes.

28
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,720
And then there I will simply import my controller.

29
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:07,640
So Konst error a controller is imported by going to the control as folder and there too the error.

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:14,870
JS file and we can now take that air or controller here and down there on app use.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,600
I will simply put aero controller get 4 0 4 just like this as a reference to this function.

32
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,530
And now this is all in line with the Alber routes and with the Alber products controller.

33
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,450
So this is now the controller being added.

34
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,060
And with that we get Due's and controllers.

35
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,970
Let's move on to the model next.
