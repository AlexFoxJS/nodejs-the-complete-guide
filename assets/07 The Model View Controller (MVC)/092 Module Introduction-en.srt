1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:08,500
In this module I want to dive into a very important aspect of building web applications back and applications

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,530
like the one we're building.

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,330
We want to follow a certain pattern for structuring our code.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:22,810
And with that I don't really just mean how we split it over a files or how we write to code but I mean

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:30,100
how we logically separate our code and two different functions it fulfills or of different things it

6
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,180
does.

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:37,810
We'll dive into the MVC pattern and you'll understand in this module what this actually is and how we

8
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,460
can add it in our project.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:46,540
And of course we'll not just added to the existing project but will also advance our project to get

10
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,320
closer to that online shop we're building.
