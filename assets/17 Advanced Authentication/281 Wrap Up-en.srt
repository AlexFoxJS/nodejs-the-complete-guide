1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:08,780
In this module we had a look at some advanced authentication related topics Namely we had to look at

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:15,140
password resetting and there it was important to understand that you of course have to implement password

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,170
reset in a way that prevents users from resetting Random User Accounts.

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:26,780
Therefore we implemented such a short lived password token so that it's not valid forever.

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:34,880
To reduce the chance of it being generated by some brute force attack and therefore our Reset token

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,840
is a great mechanism to identify the user for whom we want to reset the password to tokin has to be

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,110
generated in a way that is random.

8
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,050
Unguessable at least in a reasonable amount of time.

9
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,680
Hence the expiration date and unique.

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,390
And in this module we implemented a token in exactly that way.

11
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:03,110
We also had a look at all Farai sation and off recession is all about locking down access for authenticated

12
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:09,020
users because just because you're offended that you're not allowed to do everything you might be locked

13
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,910
in and you're using the account but you can't edit my course because you are not the creator of the

14
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:20,240
course and that's the idea of authorization and that is also what we did in this module when we ensured

15
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:26,550
that only users who created a product can actually do edit and delete it.

16
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,380
So off session is a crucial part of most applications.

17
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:36,950
And together with authentication which is the surrounding topic of having users in general you can really

18
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:43,560
control which Wiznitzer can do what in your web app in your web site.
