1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,130
So how can we at all for I say.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,720
I sure that I can't delete or edit this book with or this product with the wrong account.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,380
Now we do have important information stored on the product.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,990
We know which user did create it.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:22,780
So in the end we just want to check if it's currently locked and user is the user who created that before

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,830
allowing any edits to that item.

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:33,550
And that means that on the admin controller where we render our admin list here get products here.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,790
I only want to render products that were created by the locked end user because there is no sense in

9
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:46,520
showing products on this page that were not created by the user because were in the admin section.

10
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,720
You are not able to do anything with it if you weren't a creator.

11
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:56,080
So authorisations simply means we restrict to permissions and we can do that by restricting the data

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,590
we return for example.

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:05,770
So here when I find products I dont find all but Ill add a filter and filter for products where the

14
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:13,480
user ID is equal to the user id of the currently locked in user so user ID is equal to request user

15
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,720
id ID.

16
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:23,420
And keep in mind request user exists because we do extract that user in actually yes in a separate middleware.

17
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,030
Here they are.

18
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,130
I do store the user request.

19
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:38,070
User so I know that only products which were created by that user should be retrieved with that change.

20
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:47,760
If I reload this page I find no products for test 2 but if I do log in with my other account with test

21
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,960
at tests dot com and I go to Aben products I do find that book.

22
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,920
So that is the first important step forwards.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,250
The problem is I could theoretically still issue requests behind the scenes where I do try to delete

24
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,070
a product which was not created by me.

25
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,200
So more protection is needed.

26
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,590
Lets add that next.
