1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:07,060
So let's give this a try this reset back and it's for did we first of all need to make sure that our

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,400
newly added control or actions can be reached.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,480
So we added get reset route.

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:20,860
Now we also need to add post reset route so that this reset password button actually works.

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,800
So let's add this route and execute post reset that action we worked on.

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:35,520
And with that the reset password page let's first of all try out an incorrect or Al e-mail one which

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,030
does not exist in the database and we get this message which is great.

8
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:47,460
Now I use a real email which you used for signing up and clicked reset password or you should be redirected

9
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,310
back.

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,400
And if you check your emails there you should have a password reset email with a link.

11
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:01,200
If you click that link you should end up on a page not found error but you will see that were on reset

12
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,880
and then some token and that token can also be seen in your user collection here.

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,950
This is the password reset token which restored.

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,490
So now we just need to add some logic to add does route extract that token valid date wherever we have

15
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:23,970
a user for the token and then offer a form that allows the user to set a new password.

16
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,450
Let's work on that next.
