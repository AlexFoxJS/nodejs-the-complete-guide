1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,540
We're restricting the amount of products we can see.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,270
And that is one great step forward.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:14,200
But it still doesn't mean we can't send requests somehow by by creating our own pages where we still

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,490
try to delete a number product.

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:24,960
So we should also add protections in our post actions like in post edit and post delete product there

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:30,700
we want to check that the product I try to delete is really created by the user who is currently locked

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,220
in.

8
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,300
So in post edit product there I might want to add a check.

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:42,400
Once I found the product it should be added that where I see if I'm allowed to edit that product.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,920
So you're in the then block where I have that product fetched from the database there I will quickly

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:59,050
check if product user ID is not equal to request user ID because if it's not equal then this means the

12
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,800
wrong user is trying to edit this.

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:10,030
So here I don't want to return and simply redirect back to the starting page let's say because we try

14
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,530
to do something fishy here.

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,830
We don't want to continue.

16
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,290
So all the code will now not run.

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,650
We would still go into that.

18
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:25,080
Then block though as you learned because the next then block is still executed even if I do redirect

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,120
here.

20
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,400
So to circumvent this I'll add.

21
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,360
Then right after his savior.

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:40,100
So I nested then block so to say and now we have protection place that ensures that we can start editing

23
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:47,570
products that don't belong to us to quickly check this all temporarily remove my filters so that I can

24
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,380
see all the products again and I will log in with the wrong account.

25
00:01:51,830 --> 00:02:00,540
So if test to and now what we should see is that when I edit this and add a couple of exclamation marks

26
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:09,900
and click Update I'm redirected to edit wasn't saved because I essentially ended up in my extra check

27
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:18,350
here and it was redirect that back but with out saving the changes because this code was never executed.

28
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:24,970
Now let's try the same for deleting before I reset my filter here for deleting.

29
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:31,520
I also want to check if I'm really allowed to delete that product and we can easily implement this by

30
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,290
changing our deletion method here and use delete one.

31
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:44,990
And there I wanted to lead the product where the ID is equal to the prod ID but also where the user

32
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,090
ID is equal to the request.

33
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,500
User ID.

34
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,920
So both has to be true.

35
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,900
Now the Product ID alone is not enough to user id also asked to match and therefore even if we have

36
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,730
a valid user id it will not delete this product if the user ID does not match.

37
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:09,530
So if I saved this and I go to Aben products with the wrong account still and they click delete.

38
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,330
You see the product doesn't go anywhere.

39
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,550
Still there.

40
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,940
Now let me add that filter and get products again so that we can't even see it.

41
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,480
And now we have the best possible set up because now we can really only see it in that account where

42
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,420
we are able to interact with it.

43
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:34,420
So if I do log in with that valid account there I do see it and there I now all this should be able

44
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,680
to edit it though if I try that it fails.

45
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,290
So let's explore what's wrong here in the next lecture.
