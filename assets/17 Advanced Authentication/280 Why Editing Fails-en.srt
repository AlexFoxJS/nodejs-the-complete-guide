1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,440
Editing fails here.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,520
And do you have an idea why it fails.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,930
It fails because of my check here.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,160
I compared the product user ID to request user ID.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:18,390
Now we have a type problem again I should convert both to a string because I'm all checking for Typee

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,250
quality.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:27,770
So with this change both converge to a string and not does strange object id thing with this emplace.

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,440
Now if I log in or if I'm locked in with the right account.

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,660
Now I can update this and I can also delete this.

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,330
So this now all works with the right account.

11
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,370
So with the account who created it.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,210
But it will not work if I log in with the wrong account because of a log in there.

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,990
So this is now their account which did not create it.

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,060
I can view it on the normal pages.

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,980
I can add it to my card if I want to but under Edit products I do not see it.

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,120
And even if I would see it I could not interact with it.
