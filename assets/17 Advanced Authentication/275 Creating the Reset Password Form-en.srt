1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:09,920
So we got to tell can let's now add a form which allows to user to enter a new password.

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,750
And for that I will go into my views folder again the all folder there.

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:24,730
New password dot Ejaz or however you want to name this and they all use my log NHS page copy all that

4
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,240
content into here.

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:35,040
And then let's just maybe grab our password field here remove to e-mail for sure you can't add you email

6
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,250
re-enabled a button to update password.

7
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,430
You need to see SRF token the action here should be maybe new password whatever you want.

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,820
A POST request to new password reset password does not make any sense here.

9
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,200
So let's remove that link.

10
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,220
And now we got a prepared password page.

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,560
Now we want to load debt.

12
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:05,950
So we need a controller action exports get new password maybe where we again have the free arguments

13
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,510
we all know and love and in there let's render a view.

14
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,010
So I'll just copy that rest surrender method.

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,330
And I want to render my off new dash passwords new path is new.

16
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,550
New passwords and your the title can be new password.

17
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:32,320
I also will add my code for extracting a potential error message if I should work with one.

18
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,510
So now I have my get new password action.

19
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,980
Obviously I don't just want to render a dead view here though.

20
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,270
I also want to check whether I find a user for data token which I receive here because this will be

21
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,420
the page we load for this page where we do have a token.

22
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,020
Indeed you are.

23
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,560
So let's retrieve that token.

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,470
First of all by request from request Perens token.

25
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,440
Let's say we'll need to add a route later that and Cote's the token in a token field in our parameters

26
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,560
and then all of find one user where it is token fits now.

27
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,190
Our tokens are generated in a random non guessable way.

28
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,680
You can also enter random tokens and start editing passwords of Abra users and even if you could you

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:27,080
would not know to in email addresses so here or find a token with the reset token field which we add

30
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,100
at your reset token.

31
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:35,790
So looking for Racette token being equal to the token I have your end we want to make sure that it's

32
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:44,220
still valid from a date perspective so that the documents find does not just fulfil this criteria but

33
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:55,620
another one to add more criteria with Colma that the reset token expiration is still well higher than

34
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,700
the current date.

35
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,590
For data I can use a special operator wrapped in curly braces.

36
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,870
Dollar Sign G.T. stands for a greater than and I can simply compare if it's greater than now for the

37
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:13,830
current date and time only if the token matches and the token expiration is still greater than now so

38
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,070
the token expiration is in the future.

39
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,970
Only then I have to use or I wanted to find.

40
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:27,630
So here I'll add then and catch log any errors I might be getting.

41
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:34,040
And then the then block I get the user for whom we want to reset the password.

42
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,010
So it's here inside of that.

43
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:47,090
Then block that I want to render my new password the You and I want to pass my user ID to that view

44
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,190
so that I can include it in the post request where we will update the password.

45
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:57,440
So here I will include user ID too.

46
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,150
String maybe to convert it from an object ID to a real string.

47
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:09,820
So now we render a new password and on the new password page I will duplicate my hidden C is our token

48
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:15,090
field because I'll also have a user ID field now which is also hidden right output.

49
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,450
Dead user id I'm passing into the view so does input is new.

50
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:25,750
With that hidden user ID and it will output that user ID will need deadfall to post requests when we

51
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,680
want to save our new password.

52
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:37,330
OK so with that let's go to our routes to offer routes here and let's add a new get to Routier to get

53
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:44,360
new password route where I will use the get new password controller action.

54
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,420
Now it's not just new password by the way or it will not be new password at all it will be reset.

55
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,460
But then there will be a token.

56
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,890
So you are Ls reset and then a dynamic parameter.

57
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:02,830
The token parameter and it has to be named token here because in that get new password off controller.

58
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:10,270
I am looking for token in my parents so token here which I'm looking for in request parens means I have

59
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,960
to name it token here as well.

60
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,560
And with that let's go back and reload this page.

61
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:24,430
And now I'm on that update password page which is looking good now and next let's add the logic to updates

62
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,120
that password.
