1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,200
So let's start with resetting passwords.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,390
Obviously that's a common thing you need to do in applications.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,710
People forget passwords.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:17,900
You want to offer them a way of resetting them for that we will need a new view and some new routes.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,740
Let's start with their view maybe.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:27,170
So in the off folder I'll add reset Ejay last fall you can name it however you want.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,630
You could name and password reset.

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:28,870
E.J..

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,710
Yes of course I'll copy my log in Ejaz code pasted in there.

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,950
But of course adjusted a little bit.

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,380
I'll still leave the error message here because eventually I might display one.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,200
I don't want the password field here but I need to see or token and any email field because I want users

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,640
to enter the email for which they want to reset the password.

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,060
Then here I'll label this button reset password like this.

15
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,980
So now we have that reset Ejay as the new.

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,720
Let's now go to the off controller file and add some new actions to it.

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,890
So export a new action which I'll name get reset.

18
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,830
That should simply render that reset page.

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:20,710
So here we have the well-known function with the free arguments and in there all use response Rander

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,550
and will render a page just as we did it many times before.

21
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:30,780
So I'll just copy that from up here to type less render a page off reset.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,400
Is the view Porth here.

23
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,190
The path to your L will be just slash reset.

24
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:42,040
Let's say title of the page could be reset password.

25
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,890
Now regarding the error message.

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,640
I'll also copy that this code here where I extract any message that might exist and pass it to to view.

27
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,380
And with that we get decontrol or action.

28
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:58,070
Let's now create a fitting route in the off route's file.

29
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:06,480
Here I will add and you get route to slash reset and use off controller get resets your.

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,270
This is the route I want to load when we request a password reset.

31
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:16,520
With that we just need a way to reach that route and that would be on the log in page of course there.

32
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,570
To load a form we want to offer a reset password link.

33
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:28,670
So here I'll add a new link which leads to slash reset where I say reset password like dat.

34
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:37,550
Well that's all the wrap that in some Dith and give div a class of center it does as a class.

35
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,300
I did find earlier in the course no back on the log in page.

36
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,870
If we reloaded we have reset passwords here.

37
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,750
Now you can work on the styling if you want.

38
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,290
The main thing is if I click on it I'm taking to my reset password page.

39
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:56,720
Now the idea would be that you enter a password and then you receive an email with a password reset

40
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,000
link.

41
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,250
Now let's start working on that in the next actress.
