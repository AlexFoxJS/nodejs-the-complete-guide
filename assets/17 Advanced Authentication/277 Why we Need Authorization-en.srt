1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,080
So we worked a lot on resetting passwords.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,550
Let's now work on offer I sation.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:14,210
And with that I mean that not every authenticated user is allowed to do everything.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,490
A good example would be this one.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,390
I'm not locked in.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:26,260
Now let me log in with this user here test a test that can here I might be able to add a product and

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:32,800
I can delete products but right now I can delete all products no matter if I created them or if someone

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,890
else created them.

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:42,160
And the same is true for editing them offer a sation means that I restrict permissions all a logged

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,020
in user.

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:49,420
So every user might be able to add anything to the card including products created by the user but you

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,080
might not be able to delete and edit products which were not created by you.

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,540
So for now I can do that.

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,810
But that's exactly what I want to work on next.

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,760
So that we can do this.

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,970
Now how can we implement that.

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,420
Well when I create a new product let me quickly do that.

18
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,180
Remember I'm locked in with test at test dot com.

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:19,630
This was created by test at test dot com when I created this product here.

20
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,160
We have it here and we can see it in the product collection obviously it's linked to the user with an

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,180
ID that ends with E 5.

22
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,410
And if we have a look at all our users let me delete this one here.

23
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,310
Then we see this is the one with E5.

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,830
It is to test to test that user.

25
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:44,580
Now if I log in with my test to account so test to hear

26
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,090
then if I go to Aben products I can also edit and delete that.

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,210
And that is exactly what I want to prevent.

28
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,920
Let's do that in the next lecture.
