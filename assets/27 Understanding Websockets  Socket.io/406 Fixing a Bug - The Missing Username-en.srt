00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,020
By the way if you're wondering why there is no name be displayed.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:16,490
I have a bike on my back and code you're in get posts we should add populate creator to not just fetched

3
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,130
treat or ID but the full object for the creator and uncreate post.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,010
Well there we have the issue that the post I am sending for a socket I O is just a post object where

5
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:33,780
I did at my creator ID but not all the creator data.

6
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,950
Now how can we fix that or how can we add more data.

7
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:46,610
Well we can send the entire post underscore doc data so all the data about the post but set to create

8
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,970
equal to an object where we do have the underscore ID that will be our request.

9
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,780
User ID

10
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:04,860
but where I also then add my name field which will be user name and user name can be used because of

11
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,360
fetching to use here and that will be an object which also has a name.

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,040
So that's just a little tweak We want to add to your to send all the data with a created post that we

13
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,210
need on the front end.

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,050
We now save that and we reload we get the data up because of that change and get posts and if I now

15
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:33,480
add a new post and number DAQ choose Adak as some content except we all see the name there.

16
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,460
Now both users are named Max but still keep in mind the left user are locked in with is a different

17
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,510
user than on the right and still we get the updates here due to socket IO.
