1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,880
So now we also manage updating why a socket I.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,510
There's one tiny thing you might be wondering about.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,390
If we create a new post like a duck again.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,620
Where I at the imagines I'm content.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,980
It does show up at the top but once I reload it's actually at the bottom of the list.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,320
Well there's simply Ju-Ju How has sort on the back end.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:34,020
When I get all posts here in a feature Ask controller get posts there we simply have to sort

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:42,230
by created at date in a descending way.

9
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,830
And now by doing that if I reload on the front end our latest posts come first there too.

10
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:54,830
So that's just some tiny cosmetics which better align with the rest of our application of course.

11
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,060
It doesn't affect the way we use socket Io of course.
