1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:07,580
We're now using Sokolow to successfully update and create posts.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,260
Now let's of course awls a line deletion of posts.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,720
And for that let's first of all go back to the back end quote to defeat the controller and find our

4
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,110
elite host methods here.

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,010
There it is now just as before.

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,610
I won a mountain event once we're done deleting.

7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:32,510
So I will do that right before I sent my response here let's say I will use i o get I O to get that

8
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:40,640
connection and then I will admit to the Post's channel and I will keep my pattern of defining what happened

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,130
to my posts instead of the data package I'm emitting so I'll add my action which I'll name delete or

10
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:55,690
where I have a value of the lead I should say and then my post field here is just a post ID perps written

11
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,300
like that which in this delete post function.

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,730
I am extracting up there so I'm passing that ID through that event.

13
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,280
I'm now emitting Frue socket IO.

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,900
That is what happens on the backend.

15
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,570
Now let's move on for undealt to react.

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,660
Code of course and there just as before.

17
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,170
We want to do something when we delete the post and I'll keep it simple.

18
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,260
I'll simply reload the page here.

19
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,130
You could of course implement some cohered that simply finds that post a change and just delete said.

20
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:30,500
But I'll keep it relatively simple and just load the entire page.

21
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:40,040
If we scroll down a little bit to the delete post handler here we can tell for all the comment out this

22
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:46,580
code and instead just call this load posts to reload the page but reload the posts.

23
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,500
Essentially this will make sure that page anation also is considered correctly.

24
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:59,030
And now if it will up again to component add mound where I have my listeners for Succot I'll I'll check

25
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:05,570
if the date action might be delete which is the latest action we're emitting on the server and then

26
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,890
I just call this load posts to basically load all posts again.

27
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,220
Now this my Front-End code and now they go back to my application and I do delete a number.

28
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:22,830
Here it reloads and it also reloaded the posts on the page as you see.

29
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:29,570
So now we're also orchestrating deletion to have my trust multiple clients fruit socket IO.
