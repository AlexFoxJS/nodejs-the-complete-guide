00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:08,030
You want to go to our re-act app and Daryl quit the development server to and here I will also install

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:14,110
and you package with NPM installed dash dash save and that will be a socket on Io dash client.

3
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,750
So it's a different package name it's socket IO dash client because it is to code that will run on the

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,580
client.

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,180
Hit enter and this will install that package into our Riak project.

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,970
Not once does a stun go to defeat it japes fall in your re-act project and they are at the top.

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,690
First of all import with that Front-End and ports and text that differs from the back and send texts

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,650
and you can learn more about that in my re-act horse.

9
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:46,560
But their import open socket you can name it however you want but this will be a function that opens

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,940
and you Connection use socket implored open Sarkin from Succot IO dash client.

11
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,710
So from that packet you're just the start.

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,220
So this exposes a function on the client too.

13
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,920
And this is a function that allows you to connect.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,170
Now let's go to that component that Mount function your where we load our first posts and so on.

15
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,500
And after we loaded these posts here after this line let's call this open socket function.

16
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,650
And now you need to define d.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,910
You are on a server where you've established your socket IO server and that of course is our back and

18
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,990
server address.

19
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,370
So it's HTP localhost ADHD.

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,810
Nothing else is required.

21
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,350
And please note you do use HTP here because web sockets build up on that.

22
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,850
And now this function which is provided by Succot I will do all the heavy lifting behind the scenes.

23
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,860
And if we now safe that we restart our front end to the back is running as well.

24
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,880
Let's wait for that development server to restart.

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,560
So of our application here in the browser will actually reload.

26
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:58,610
And now this should have already executed this open socket code because the page did reload.

27
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:04,880
So if you now go to the back and you indeed see client connected here because now we got an established

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:12,410
connection between a client and our back and application through socket IO and all the other normal

29
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,280
HTP requests will still work as before.

30
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,190
Now let's use that connection for something useful.

31
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,080
And let's see what we could do with that socket IO connection.

32
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,100
That would make sense in our appier.
