00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:07,700
If we have a look at our application you're What could we do in real time.

2
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:13,420
Well what would be interesting is that if we create a new post with user aid that we can instantly see

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:20,140
it with user be to and for that we need to add some code in our client.

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:27,350
And then also on our backend Now let's actually start with the client.

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:36,510
Let's say we want to react to a new post being created and we then want to render it in the client instantly.

6
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:44,200
For this in my re-act that offer this component that MT function before lotos let's say I'll add a new

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,660
function at post with this.

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,680
So next I expect to get the data about the post as an argument.

9
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,820
So I'm using a normal Erol function here.

10
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,960
And then here I want to render that post to the screen.

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,400
Now for that since this is not a re-act course I prepared some code which you find attached to this

12
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,090
video.

13
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:11,260
Just copy it here in this code snippet we're using some re-act functionality set state to basically

14
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:18,860
update our existing data we used in this re-act application with this new post received here.

15
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:24,700
And I will take care about page nation to insert this post in the right place.

16
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,260
That is the end what I'm doing here.

17
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,060
Important thing is dead.

18
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:33,910
I'm using some re-act functionality here so that we don't have to reload the browser page.

19
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,250
I simply changed the existing dorm.

20
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,580
This is what re-act will do for me with this code snippet.

21
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,680
And as mentioned before if you want to learn more about re-act dive into some dedicated re-act resources

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,000
of course.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now we got ADD post but we're never calling it.

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:57,310
My idea is that I want to call it whenever we do create a new post on some other client.

25
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,680
Now how do we do that well.

26
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,370
For that let's go back to the node code.

27
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:10,020
We have to go to the place that's runs or to the code that runs when a new post is created.

28
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,480
And that would be in the feed controller to create post function of course.

29
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,820
There we want to use socket.

30
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:24,300
I owed the existing connection we have set up to basically inform all connected clients about the new

31
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,170
host that is the idea.

32
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,570
Now for that however we need to share that connection which we currently set up and actually yes.

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,130
How do we get that connection out of actually into feature.

34
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,400
Well let's do that and continue with the set up and next lectures.
