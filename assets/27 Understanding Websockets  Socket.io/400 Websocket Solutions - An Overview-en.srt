00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:07,610
Now for adding web sockets you've got a broad variety of methods to use.

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:14,330
If you google for node web sockets or node Express Web sockets you'll find a lot of articles and packages

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,560
you can use.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:24,750
One of the most popular packages however is socket I O Succot I know is a package that uses WEP sockets

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,210
and gives you a lot of convenience features around that protocol that make it very easy to set up a

6
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,280
web socket channel.

7
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:37,080
But when a client and a server and to use that channel you can learn all about it here and the official

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,820
docs.

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,980
Does this nose socket I O course so will not cover every single feature it offers.

10
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,510
But I will show you how to add it to a project and how to set up some basic communication.

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:55,050
So socket IO is what it will use and socket IO and that is the key thing I want you to understand does

12
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:01,570
use the web socket technology the web socket protocol and sets it up behind the scenes for you.

13
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,680
You don't have to use socket I O to use WEP sockets though you could use one of the Avar options I showed

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,790
you on Google before there are packages that give you a more raw approach with less convenience features

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,700
and that might be what you're looking for for specific operations.

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,540
We'll go with the convenient solution of socket I O here though and I strongly recommend diving into

17
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:31,200
some advanced resources if you want to learn all about web sockets or socket I O specifically.

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,670
So how can we add it to our project now.
