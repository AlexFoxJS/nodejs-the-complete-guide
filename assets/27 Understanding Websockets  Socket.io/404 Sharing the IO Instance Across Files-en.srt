1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:09,270
To be able to read was one and the same I O object dad manages the same connection that is exposed.

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,400
Let's create a new file name its socket touchiest a name is up to you though.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,890
And in that file here I will create a new variable which I'll name I own.

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:26,900
And then all export with the notes as exports and takes an object in that object I want to have two

5
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,110
methods to functions the init method.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:38,270
And does how you define a function in no chase syntax you have that key here like in a normal object

7
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:45,480
then a colon and then the value and the value here is a function which receives the HTP server as an

8
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,280
argument.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:54,320
And then the function body using an arrow function here of course in the function body you require some

10
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:54,870
video.

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,060
So just as we do it and actually yes here we require socket IO and we passed a server to the function

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,960
that gets exposed by the exported object or by it it exported package.

13
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:13,120
So here I awls execute this function and I pass in that HTB server I expect to get here as an argument.

14
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:22,930
Now the result of that is our i o object which l store and that I O variable here and then I can return

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,450
IO like dis Indian function in Aperture.

16
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,870
Yes I can now require slash socket.

17
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,310
So my own socket Yes file.

18
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,890
And there I will call init dysfunction.

19
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:45,250
I just a find in there so this function I call that and there is still passed my server because in that

20
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:52,610
function I expect to get that server jarocho here does not change its stays the way it is.

21
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,340
Yes I now just add another function.

22
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,680
So an average key value pair in that exported object.

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,990
So let's add a comma and then I'll name does get I O.

24
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,270
The name is up to you just as it was for in this.

25
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:12,280
By the way here I don't expect any arguments but in the function body I'll check if I O does not exist.

26
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:21,550
So if this variable is undefined in which case I'll throw in a new era or socket I O not initialized

27
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,130
or something like that.

28
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,430
If I make it past as if Geck I know that I O has been initialized and then I will just return it.

29
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,320
Now is this.

30
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:37,030
We're managing a connection in this file and we can import this fall in all the places of our app where

31
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,130
we need to be able to interact with IO like our feet.

32
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,800
JS controller so let's continue with that next.
