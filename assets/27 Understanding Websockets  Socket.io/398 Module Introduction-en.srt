1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,730
A lot of exciting things were covered in the last modules rest API is a single weight and we'll continue

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,540
on that road.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:16,800
We'll dive into a very exciting technology that you can use in node applications web sockets web sockets

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:24,210
are a nice way a protocol essentially which allows us to build real time web services.

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,290
Now what exactly does that mean and how does that work.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,640
That is what we'll cover in this module.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,060
You'll learn why you would want to use real time web services and what that actually is and we'll see

8
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:43,590
how we add real time communication to our node app or to any node app of course will use a certain library

9
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,950
for that socket IO and I will teach you everything you need to know about why to use it how it works

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,240
what you can do with that and how you use it in your project.
