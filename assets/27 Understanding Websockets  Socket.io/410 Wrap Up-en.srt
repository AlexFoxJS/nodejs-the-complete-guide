1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:08,040
So in we had a closer look at some video and I hope it became clear what you can do with it.

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:15,420
You can push information from the server to the client through that emit method provided by socket IO.

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,480
And I also mentioned that socket IO is not the only way of implementing WEP sockets because behind the

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,240
scenes it's that web sockets protocol that allows you to push data from the server to connect the client

5
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:35,310
socket I O just makes using that WEP socket protocol that technology particularly easy and therefore

6
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:42,600
it's a very popular package definitely dive into the official docs office socket IO to learn all about

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,720
the different features it offers and what you can do with it because it's a very powerful library it

8
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,520
gives you a lot of cool features.

9
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,460
So definitely check out the official docs to learn more about it.

10
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,970
And of course also have a look at our implementations you might be able to use.

11
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:07,230
I just want you to be aware that web sockets are something that build up on HTP you established them

12
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,730
as you'd see in our application as a HTP handshake.

13
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:19,350
So you need a running HTP server ever set up with just no JSM or a package like Express and you can

14
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,000
use that server to establish Succot a socket connection on top of that.

15
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,620
So both run simultaneously.

16
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:33,370
And as you see in our example app we actually got both going on we got normal requests.

17
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,410
So to say and we take advantage of socket IO as well.

18
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:43,010
So this is an exciting piece of technology that might be interesting for your next application too.

19
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,420
And I hope that this module provided a nice introduction to it.
