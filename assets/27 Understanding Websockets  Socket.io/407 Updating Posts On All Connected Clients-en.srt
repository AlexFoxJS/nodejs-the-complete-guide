1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,020
Now we worked on code that allows us to mid end event and we create a new post.

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,720
Now obviously we're not just creating posts rules or updating or deleting posts.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,350
We want to be able to handle that.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:21,280
Q Now let's do that together and let's continue with updating posts on the back end of the feed controller.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,490
I'll scroll down to the update post Methot and in there we won a midnight event.

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,830
Once we're done updating.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:34,830
So towards the end once we got our result we saved the post and we're sending a response here.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,300
I'll again use IO get IO to get access to our established I O connect.

9
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:48,180
You could say and again emit on this post's channel and I'll limit my data just as before.

10
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:54,370
Now I will keep my pattern of having an action where I this time right update because this ISDE action

11
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:59,080
were performed and my post asked and my result here calls for assault.

12
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,510
Turns out to be the result of my saving operation.

13
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:09,670
Now just as before I want to be sure that I also have some user data in there so will actually scroll

14
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,410
up where we find that post and how well populated with my creator data.

15
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,910
This again will take that creator ID which we stored in the post object.

16
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:24,940
Reach out to the users database for the users collection fetched data for that specific user and added

17
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,820
here in our host.

18
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:34,480
Now I do admit this event where I sent my created post.

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,960
And let's now go back to our front application year and also establish some code here to update our

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,080
posts for this ofter does add post function.

21
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,830
I'll add a new function which I'll name update.

22
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:55,340
Post Re again get my post data and then I do something with that in the Arrow function and ask before

23
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:01,970
I prepared some code which we just copy in there which will add or which will update to post in our

24
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,310
list of posts.

25
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:10,580
Now also scroll down in your re-act code here in the same file to finish edits hndler because there

26
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,750
were all to have some logic to edit the post here.

27
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,480
I will get rid of debt.

28
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,150
I will actually get rid of this entire part here and also of my update post assignment index returns

29
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:29,690
statement in set state call because I now no longer updated here but I do admit the event to all connect

30
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:36,380
clients including to clients who did well sent that update and therefore I can also set up my listener

31
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,300
and stead.

32
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,300
With this new update post function I copied it up there.

33
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:48,580
So let me now go up and here where I have my established Lisner 40 post-event.

34
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,720
I'll add the else block to see if the action maybe is update.

35
00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:00,910
If it's not create in which case I'll call this update post and past data post to that.

36
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:07,130
Now before this will work let me go back to the service side code and there since I do populate my creator

37
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,960
when find that post in the update post function near this check your will actually fail where I do check

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,480
F.D. ID which is now not the ID any more but the full Creager object is equal to the request user ID.

39
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,780
So here I actually want to access creator dot underscore ID to string right because we're populating

40
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,150
to create field with the full user data.

41
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,580
It's not just the ID anymore.

42
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,880
So you would fail editing this post.

43
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:38,830
If we don't make this change and now if we save both and we go back and reload both pages I deleted

44
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,430
one post in the meantime so I only got to any more.

45
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,970
And let me now edit this post here and a couple of thanks to my remarks maybe and click.

46
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:54,410
Except and you'll see it added or being changed on both clients.

47
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,770
So this is not also working.
