1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:09,550
Now you could spend hours working on this application to add all the functionalities we need to add

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:18,500
products to a cart or to also interact with users with orders and we can do all of that with these sequinned

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:18,990
queries.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,570
We're already writing here.

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:26,700
The problem is degrees will get more and more complex to more complex our application logic becomes.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:32,650
And at some point we'll have to connect tables because one thing we're not using right now are relations

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,590
because we only got one table.

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,170
Now we can do all that just with the sequel package and if you're a sequel or a sequel master in general

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,250
you could definitely do that for the rest of us.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,850
There is a way easier approach to that which allows us to not write all these queries we don't have

11
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:59,010
to write any sequel code but instead only work with native javascript objects that give us certain functionalities

12
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,930
we need for connecting to them deleting them adding them and so on will you.

13
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:09,750
And now for third party package we can add to this application that makes our life a bunch easier.

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,340
I just wanted to show you how you generally can add sequel and write your own queries as the next step

15
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,290
will not write our own queries.

16
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,570
Instead we'll find an easier approach in the next module with sequel's.
