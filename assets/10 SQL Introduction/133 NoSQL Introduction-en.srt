1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,340
We had to look at sequel based databases.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,320
Now it's time to look at no sequel based databases.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:14,080
Now the name no sequel simply means that it doesn't follow the approach sequel follows.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:21,730
It also uses a different language but instead of having schemas and relations no sequel has iver focuses

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,350
her on her strengths.

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:30,400
So in those sequel we can still have a database and we can give this database a name shop let's say.

7
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,190
Now that's the same for a sequel right away.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,270
There we all have databases now in sequel.

9
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,190
We then had tables users and orders and maybe all the products.

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,740
These are just examples here.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:49,310
Now Infoseek Well tables are called collections but you can think of them as tables so as to table equivalent

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,320
but we call them collections in the world.

13
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:59,470
Now in collection we don't find records but so-called documents which looked like this.

14
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,330
And since we're working with javascript in this course here we of course can kind of see that this looks

15
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,020
a bit like a javascript object.

16
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:13,300
So documents are very close to how we describe data in Javascript you could say now that our documents

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,180
in our collections and what you can already see here in the user's collection Exxon-Mobile is that no

18
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,810
sequel doesn't have a strict schema here we got two documents in the same collection.

19
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:32,460
But the second document manual here does not have an H and that is perfectly fine in no sequel.

20
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,670
You can store multiple documents with different structures in the same collection.

21
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:43,780
Now often you'll of course still try to have kind of a similar structure but it's also not uncommon

22
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:49,630
for some applications that you don't always have exactly the same fields away level for the data.

23
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,010
You are storing in the database and that is ok and no sequel.

24
00:01:53,050 --> 00:02:00,230
You can definitely store documents which are generally equal but whereas some fields might differ.

25
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:05,440
One other thing is that in the sequel world we got no real relations.

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,720
Instead we go for duplicate data.

27
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:13,020
Now that simply means that if we have orders collection here we have a nested document.

28
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:19,970
The user which also is stored as a separate document with more details may be in the users collection

29
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,740
and we don't connect that to some idea or behind the scenes set up relation.

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,880
Instead we simply duplicate data to be precise.

31
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,840
The data we need in the order is collection year.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,320
That of course means that if that data changes we have to update it in multiple places.

33
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,130
If all these places need the latest update or the latest data change but that can be OK because this

34
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:50,540
only gives us a huge advantage that if we ever retrieve data we don't have to join multiple tables to

35
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:57,850
gabber which can lead to very long and difficult code and which can also impact performance.

36
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:03,040
Instead we can simply reads the data from the orders collection and we probably got all the data we

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,040
need to display on the orders page without having to reach out to collections.

38
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,220
And for this can be done in a super fast way and that is one of the huge advantages of no sequel.

39
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,800
It can be very fast and efficient.

40
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,420
So no sequel characteristics in general are that we have no strong data schema.

41
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,410
We can have mixed data in the same collection.

42
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,470
No structure is required and that we have generally no data or relations.

43
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,820
Now we can relate documents in some way.

44
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:38,560
And this is possible and we will see how to work with CONNECT that data in the no sequel module off

45
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,460
this course.

46
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:46,870
But generally we have no or only a few connections and instead try to copy data and have a collection

47
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,400
with documents that work on their own.

48
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,210
This is the difference.

49
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,110
We also got a difference between sequel and no sequel.

50
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,240
Regarding our scalability.

51
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:03,100
So as our application grows and we need to store more add more data and access that data or work with

52
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,450
it more frequently.

53
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:10,750
We might need to scale our database servers and we can differentiate between horizontal and vertical

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,410
scaling.

55
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:18,130
We'll have a look at this and in general how the two worlds sequel and those sequel compare in the next

56
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:18,480
lecture.
