1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:08,740
It's now finally time that we start storing our data in a more correct or realistic way because thus

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:16,000
far we either used the mammary when we just stored the data in a variable in our node program and it

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,140
was then even shared across requests or we stored it in a file and that's also not optimal because accessing

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:29,950
files is pretty slow especially as we start storing more and more data in them and it's not really something

5
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,650
we would do in a real application.

6
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:39,200
Instead there you typically would use a data base which is a specific program that allows you that is

7
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:46,600
built for storing data and for efficiently retrieving data to Denver and this module will have a look

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,620
at the different kinds of databases or two important different kinds of databases sequel and no sequel

9
00:00:53,650 --> 00:01:00,180
databases and I will compare them highlight the differences and we will actually see examples for both

10
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,510
in the course and we'll start with sequel awls and this module.

11
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:11,050
So no sequel will also follow in a separate module but let me first of all show you how you would use

12
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,630
a sequel based data base to gabber with your no JSA application.

13
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,200
This is what we'll cover and that will actually be a lot.

14
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,110
So let's dive right into it and let's learn what the different kinds of databases are and whether a

15
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:31,260
sequel or no sequel could be the right choice for your application.
