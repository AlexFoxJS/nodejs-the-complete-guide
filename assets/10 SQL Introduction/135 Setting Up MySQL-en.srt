1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,140
Now you work with sequel.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,640
We need a sequel based database and I'll go for my sequel because you can stall and use them for free

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,100
at least in the basic version which does suffice for this course.

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,870
You can visit my sequel dot com to download and install it.

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,430
And there simply click on downloads.

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,070
And scroll down.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,100
We don't need the Enterprise edition here.

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:32,010
Instead we'll go for the community edition which is to free one click on downloads there too.

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:39,940
And now what we will need is my sequel communities server and we'll all need the work bench.

10
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:45,760
Now you can also download combine and Stolar especially here for Windows you should just Giusti My sequel

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,690
on Windows Installer and tools which allows you to set up everything in one go.

12
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,620
But you can also click on my secret community server here simply and this should give you a download

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,940
which allows you to install all these things in one go.

14
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,510
Anyways so let's Giusti mystical community server here.

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,060
Always dive into the insulations attractions.

16
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,900
In case you're facing any problems on your system and then if you scroll down select your operating

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,950
system here the one you plan on using.

18
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:20,280
So for Windows you can then also download this general installer which allows you to pick the deprogrammers

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,270
you need for Mac OS.

20
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:32,390
We simply can go for this first download the DNG archive and then once you click there you don't have

21
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,010
to log in.

22
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,990
You can simply choose.

23
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,650
No thanks.

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,900
Just start my download to well start the download.

25
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,010
This can take a while because it's quite a big file.

26
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:49,910
On Windows you have the choice between downloading a web based installer which is smaller but downloads

27
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:55,100
what you need to during the installation or a complete installer which downloads everything in advance

28
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,790
once your download is done simply execute the downloaded file.

29
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,290
So even those installer.

30
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,700
Or does Mac DMCE archive here on ask.

31
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,310
Q Well continue Rudy installation wizard and I will do that.

32
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,880
Agreed to the license.

33
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:18,620
Leave the default installation Poth click on customize your though to choose what to install and make

34
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,060
sure that you doing so.

35
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,870
The My sequel server here.

36
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,650
If you're running does install or Windows you should get a different installer where you can choose

37
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:33,480
to install the MS sequel server but then also in one go install D.

38
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,360
My sequel workbench.

39
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:41,110
So make sure you select both for installation and click install here.

40
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,800
And now on both operating systems.

41
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,040
Dish should install it now.

42
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:55,940
Once installation is done a configuration process should start automatically there.

43
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:02,830
You should make sure that during this configuration process you do choose the legacy password encryption

44
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:08,890
which sounds insecure but which is perfectly fine and didn't you were worse than simply is not supported

45
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,410
by the node sequel package we're using yet.

46
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:19,150
So just the legacy password encryption and shoes next you all have to choose a password for your root

47
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,170
user and you can also leave.

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,530
Start my sequel's or once installation is complete.

49
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,580
Checked or checked if it is unchecked and click Finish

50
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:31,620
on Windows.

51
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,880
Simply leave all the settings as they are and click through them and by the end it should be done and

52
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,250
it should then also start a sequel server for you.

53
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,770
With the setup you chose your Indico figuration steps.

54
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:55,830
Now once installation is complete on Windows if you installed the mysql workbench you're done on Mac

55
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,920
or Linux.

56
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,380
You're not done yet.

57
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:05,520
Instead you should go back to this page where you chose my school community server and they're all installed

58
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,990
the mystical workbench.

59
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:13,550
The workbench basically is a client the visual client we can use to connect to our database to inspect

60
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,930
it and play around with it outside of our node application which simply makes debugging and developing

61
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,670
a bit easier.

62
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:27,630
So Tuesday my sequel work bench here and there you also can choose your operating system.

63
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:35,820
Now again on Windows if you use debt general installer you already have it download that file here again

64
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,520
you don't need to log in just start to download and wait for the download to finish.

65
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,190
So did you can again execute D-Will executable.

66
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,540
Once it is done finished the installation process as instructed.

67
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,870
By the installer and once you're done with that you should be all good.

68
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:03,980
You can now test your set up by starting the sequel workbench you just installed and then there you

69
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,000
should already see your MS sequel instance running.

70
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,660
If that is not the case.

71
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:17,120
Have a look at the attached document where I describe some common issues or in general give you some

72
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,610
links on how to make this work and how to bring this up.

73
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:28,640
You just need to make sure that your my sequel server is running and during installation you had a choice

74
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,780
to check that it should always start with your system on Mac.

75
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,620
You can also open your system preferences and there you should have the MS sequel option where you can

76
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,780
also stop and start to server to connect to the database.

77
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:52,080
Simply click on that instance and now enter that root password you assigned during the installation.

78
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:58,640
This should not allow you to connect to your sequel server instance like this.

79
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,130
Then once you enter the password you should be connect to your database system and right now this is

80
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,950
what you have basically an empty window and we won't work too much in that will of course work with

81
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,610
our database from inside our node application.

82
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:18,350
But this will allow us to conveniently look into our database from time to time and see what is stored.

83
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:24,140
And one thing we can do already is we can go down to schemas here which can be translated with database

84
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,500
here.

85
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,730
You could say and there we can define a new schema so a new database with which will work and it's not

86
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,820
complete.

87
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:37,070
You can name does whatever you want and you can also leave the opera settings here and then on the bottom

88
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,530
right and I know it's small here.

89
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,970
Unfortunately you consume in.

90
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,180
You can click Apply now.

91
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,360
This will create a new database.

92
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,730
You can say with which we can interact later you can leave all the default settings and simply click

93
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,130
apply here and now you should see that note complete thing which has a couple of tables or non right

94
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:03,980
now but where you can then later connect to and store your data in the tables that will be created here.

95
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:11,530
So with that we can continue and we can now move on with our code and start interacting with my sequel

96
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,980
from inside our node application.
