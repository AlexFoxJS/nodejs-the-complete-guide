1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,180
So time to extract this idea from the you are an.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:12,750
And for that let's go to the route's folder there in shop J.S. we want to handle a new route and I will

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,110
add it below my all products Routier.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,700
It will be a good draw because we want to display a new page for now.

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,140
And part of tipoffs products but that's not everything.

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:29,130
We also have this dynamic segment the ID d express router supports us with this.

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:37,150
We can tell the Express router that there will be some variable segment by adding a colon and then any

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,090
name of our choice like Product ID.

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,750
Later we'll be able to extract that information by dead name here.

10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,220
So remember it.

11
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:52,510
The important part is to Colan here though this signals to express that it should not look for a route

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:01:03,300
like products product ID but instead that this partir can be anything and it will simply route or load

13
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:10,670
this route for does off then and we will then be able to extract that information through that name.

14
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:19,120
Does has one important implication if you will also have another route like router get products to delete.

15
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:19,870
Let's say.

16
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,300
So that is a normal route.

17
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:27,410
Does this not a dynamic segment the order would matter if you order it like this.

18
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,800
And keep in mind that your code is parsed from top to bottom and the request goes frood at from top

19
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,720
to bottom.

20
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:40,970
If you order it like this you would never reach that route because if you had a route like product still

21
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:47,390
it expressed as would already fire at this route or would already handle it in this Routier because

22
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,110
delete would basically be treated as the dynamic segment.

23
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:56,780
So if you had at an emic segment and a specific route you would have to put the more specific route

24
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,450
first.

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,570
So for products delete does handle the request enter offer.

26
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,030
It'll not continue its journey because you don't fire next.

27
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,250
But if you don't have something else which does not match products delete then you would go into debt

28
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,250
dynamic route.

29
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,450
So this does matter here however we don't have that case.

30
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,100
I just want to mention it.

31
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,950
So for now let's simply connect a controller where we then can handle this incoming request and where

32
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,340
I then can show you how you can get this information out of the you or else.

33
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,270
And for this let's go to controllers shop genius and they're simply add a new controller.

34
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,190
I will edit been below get products the position doesn't matter.

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,810
But logically here we get all products.

36
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,400
So now I also want to add the function where we get one product.

37
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,000
So here we'll have get product BP's response next like this.

38
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,740
And in there.

39
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:58,730
Let's now extract that dynamic Pop segment or the value it holds to be precise.

40
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,640
So this will be our product ideal store it in a constant named proft ID.

41
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,030
That name is up to you.

42
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:12,500
And we can get access to it by accessing our request and then expressed as already gives us parents

43
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,130
object on our request.

44
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:24,880
And on that parents object we can access our product ID and we can access product ID here because we

45
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,650
use product ID in our rollock shop as file as a name after the colon.

46
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:37,730
So the name you use year after de colon is the name by which you can extract the data on this Perrin's

47
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,730
object.

48
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:48,190
And let me show you that this works by logging this Prod. ID and I will then for now simply redirect

49
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,590
to the starting page later will of course render a different view.

50
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,110
But for now it will do.

51
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,830
And with that I can now go to shop yes and use my controller here.

52
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,570
So connect the shop control or get product function here.

53
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,630
And with this connection setup if I now go back and please note I'm still on that route with the dynamic

54
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,590
segment.

55
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,260
If I now reload this I'm getting redirected.

56
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,220
Which means we handle this.

57
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,110
We don't get the 4 or 4 page anymore.

58
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:27,660
And in a console your eyes see my dynamic segment locked out from does line and that of course means

59
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,950
we can not just log it.

60
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,940
We can also use it.
