00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:08,330
Now before we dive into dynamic routes you need to adjust your project of it ever because you skipped

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:14,120
the last module altogether and therefore you should download the entire snapshot I attached to this

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,620
lecture which contains my latest state.

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:24,050
But you should also download that snapshot or the adjustments file which contains the files you will

5
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,490
need to add to your project in case you don't want to use my snapshot.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,260
But if you skipped the last module always go of the snapshot now when you adjustments up file and you

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:39,680
can ignore that if you download the snapshot in the adjustment zip file you will find that javascript

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,380
followed the main js file which you should move into a J s folder in the public folder.

9
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:51,620
You will also find that main Zia's as file and the product Zia's as file in there and you should also

10
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:58,030
replace yours and this is as folder with the ones you find attached because I find you in some styles.

11
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:05,630
Additionally make sure that you also replace all the views you'll find in that attached zip file and

12
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:11,720
you simply replace your existing files or their content with the attached files or the content yet hatched

13
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,600
falls.

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,700
And with that added.

15
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,390
And in case you are facing any problems simply take the snapshot with all that added.

16
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,500
Let's now start writing our dynamic route code.
