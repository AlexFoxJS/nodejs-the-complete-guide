1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:09,340
Let's make sure we can reach that Adut product page from a route and Free-Net on our products page you're

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:16,530
on the Admin Page this added link your added product should also include the idea of the product.

3
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,940
And again we can use Ejaz to simply inject that into our POV by accessing Product ID.

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,370
That's all we need here.

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,050
If we now reload this page and click Edit we get redirected.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:36,820
What could be the issue here well remember that we added our query parameter right and were checking

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:44,620
this query parameter in our controller and if we don't find the added query parameter added will be

8
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,270
undefined and therefore we get redirected.

9
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:52,090
Now this is of course just a bonus but it's important for you to understand how query parameters work

10
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:57,080
and therefore we have to set this to when creating our linked to this page.

11
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:04,830
So let's go back to products Ejaz and don't just add this idea but also simply append that query parameter

12
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,330
set added equal to true.

13
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,190
With that if I now save this and I go back to aberant products and click Edit.

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,020
Now we load this product for editing.

15
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,040
So this is looking good.

16
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,760
Let's make sure the clicking update product which does already reached a correct route dust and also

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,940
do something vidis First of all in Edmond J.S. we need to register this route.

18
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,540
So let's add a new post route which is at added product.

19
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:40,190
This will not receive any dynamic segment because it's a post request so data can be enclosed in the

20
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,080
request we're sending.

21
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,830
So let's now work on their controller here.

22
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:56,720
And add new action post edit product which of course receives the request object response object and

23
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,160
the next function as all our middleware functions which our controllers just art.

24
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,490
And then here what do we have to do.

25
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:12,440
Well we basically want to construct a new product and replace the existing one with this product.

26
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,270
This means that we have to do some work on the product model.

27
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,900
We'll do that in the next lecture.
