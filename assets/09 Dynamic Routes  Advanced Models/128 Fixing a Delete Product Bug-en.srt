1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,720
Now I'm generally pretty happy with the state of this application.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,570
But there is a minor issue in it.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,000
If we have no products in a card or at least not the product which we're trying to delete let's say

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,320
to one on the right here.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,930
We actually get an error.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:23,200
And we do get an error because we try to access the quantity of a product which we just don't have.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:29,550
And the reason for data is dead we simply use in our products just follow the all folder.

8
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,400
We used a cart model to delete the product from there.

9
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:33,270
Right.

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,200
The problem just is obviously not every product is in the cart.

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:45,880
So in the car here where we have to leave product we first of all need to check if a given product is

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,310
part of the cart.

13
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:54,520
So here when I parse the overall cart here when I find the product in the card I should check if we

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,480
really have that product because if we don't have it.

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,090
So if I add an exclamation mark in front of this.

16
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:07,860
So if this check here is true that means we don't have a product then I simply need to return here.

17
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,430
I don't want to continue.

18
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:16,330
I don't want to try to edited because it's not part of the cart so therefore now if I reload my app

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:24,400
and I quickly add a new product to your website with a price and a description like this and I'd then

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,760
click on admen products and delete this.

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,840
Now this works.
