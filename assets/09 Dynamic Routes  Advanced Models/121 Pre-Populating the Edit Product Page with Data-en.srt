1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:07,670
So to populate this forum with the product data we need to fetch the product first.

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:16,190
So for an added note here after not being redirected then I want to get my product information for this

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,250
I need the product model which I already have and I need the product ID fraud ID can be retrieved from

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,940
the incoming request because if you check the routes real quick we have that dynamic segment here.

5
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,640
So by this name we can extract the Product ID.

6
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:39,740
So Edmund J.S. here I can set or I can access request parents product ID and get that ID from the URL.

7
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:47,840
Therefore I can then use my product model and find this product by id and then here I have my callback

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,940
where I received the product that was retrieved and by the way of course you should also try to add

9
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,640
a check to see if you have a product and redirect to user in case you don't let's do it like this for

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,280
now.

11
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:07,100
So here I will now get my product and then rendered this page assuming that I always get a product and

12
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:13,050
pass my product on a product key and you can name Diski whatever you want of course.

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,000
And we can for example add a check if we don't have a product so if this is invalid if it's undefined

14
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:26,210
then we could return a redirect for now which is not the best user experience.

15
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,840
Most of the time you would want to show an error instead.

16
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,180
But let's now for now do we like this.

17
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,360
So we assume we always make it here and we get the product in the view no.

18
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,680
So let's move over to the edit product to you as you're first of all let's work on that button.

19
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,170
Right now it's at product.

20
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,320
But I want to change that button caption if we're in added mode.

21
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:54,140
Now remember we're setting this editing property year so this is a variable away that will in the template.

22
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:03,230
So here I reasonably want to check if editing and then add a curly brace.

23
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:11,560
If this is true then I actually want to display the added or maybe update product texture on the button

24
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:22,080
Oberweis and for dead all clues the first IF block here and Attah else block still in my Ejay as tax

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,900
of course.

26
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:29,040
So overwise year if we're in this Altes block here I want to show at product and thereafter I also have

27
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,700
to close my curly braces off that if statement if and I'll reload this page we see Update product correctly.

28
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,810
And by the way if they go to add product I'll now get an error because editing is not defined.

29
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:52,440
So to fix this I also have to make sure that in my controller for showing the ad product page eyes that

30
00:02:52,460 --> 00:03:00,510
editing to falles of course and now you're reloading this page will work.

31
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,120
Going back to the editing page will show us the update button.

32
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,910
Now that is one step back to the template.

33
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,640
I don't just want to show the caption here.

34
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:17,360
I also want to change the action so here on the forum the router is setting the request to should all

35
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,530
change of course.

36
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:25,470
Right now it's always add product but it should only be add product if we are not in editing mode.

37
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,400
So here indeed.

38
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,490
I will also output something dynamic

39
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,840
I will check if we're editing.

40
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,450
So all have the same logic for de Botton.

41
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:44,700
And if this is the case I went to load slash edit product let's say our wise all closed that and have

42
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:54,010
my ELSE block open up so Oberweis does is my Ejaz else block I'll add add product into my u r l here

43
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,010
and I can inject these segments into DO YOU OR.

44
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,280
Because this will just be converted to normal text in the end.

45
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,030
Does this what each asked us or what all templating engines do.

46
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,750
So all the clothes that curly brace of the else block here and with that if I saved this we should make

47
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,350
sure that if you click that update button we go to add a product.

48
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:20,010
Well let's go back and let's see if we can pre populate this with product information.

49
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:26,760
Now keep in mind that in Edmond J as I am retrieving the product whip's not here but here and get at

50
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,390
it product and I pass product information into my view.

51
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,450
So therefore in the view we can of course use that.

52
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,810
And we can set it on all our inputs here on value.

53
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,410
I also want to check if I'm in editing mode and if I am I want to display my product information if

54
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,790
I'm not I don't want to do that.

55
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,640
So same logic as before

56
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:01,750
all check if I'm editing if I am then I will display product title here because this is the title input

57
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,370
Oberweis I will not do anything and therefore I don't even need Altes block.

58
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,880
I just DUDAS if I am in editing mode.

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,530
Otherwise nothing will happen.

60
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:19,780
So for now reloaders we indeed see product title and the issue here is that of course this is simply

61
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,130
output as text to output the real value behind it.

62
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:31,930
We need debt equals Ejay as tag here nested into our other Ejaz tasks like this.

63
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,620
So this was now added equals unclosing with a dollar sign greater than sign.

64
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,820
And this can be hard to read.

65
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,530
You simply have to divide it up in blocks you've got if then you've got the output and then you've got

66
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:51,120
the closing curly brace for and with that safety if you now reload you'll see the real title behind

67
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,920
that and let's do the same for all the other values.

68
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,580
So I'll just copy that value here real quick for the image you are l.

69
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,240
I always want to output image.

70
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:07,070
You are el for the price.

71
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:13,210
I want to output a product price for the description we get a text area.

72
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:20,890
So here I will not have value equals I'll just output the value between the opening and closing text

73
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,180
area tax.

74
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,430
And here I'll put the description in it if that all saved.

75
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,050
If we reload this is looking good.

76
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,070
And now we can start editing our products.

77
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,550
Now I want to hook up that edit button so that we can really load the product and this newly added view.

78
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,700
So let's do that.

79
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:44,080
And then also work on the functionality to store the updated information over the next Electra's.
