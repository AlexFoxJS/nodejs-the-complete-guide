1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:09,440
So let's add a view or we do have you but let's add some logic in that you infer this all take the code

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,440
from one of my other simple views like orders each class and pasted in there so that I got the hat and

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,190
also my navigation and so on.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,940
Now in here I don't want to output nothing there of course.

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:32,260
Instead here I want to output my product information so my product detail for this I will quickly give

6
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:39,220
those main elements to a class of centered and find you my see is as code real quick.

7
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,590
The main idea is as follows.

8
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,310
Let's simply add a class can added anywhere.

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,710
All added relatively top centered where I said text align to center for now so that everything is centered

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,720
horizontally.

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,990
Now in there I'll put my agent one task and there I expect to get information about the product we loaded.

12
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,770
So here I want to get some product and output the title.

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,750
Now right now we're not rendering this view and we're not passing the data into it.

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,270
But eventually we will.

15
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,070
So here is my title.

16
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:19,500
Then maybe render a horizontal line and then display an image for this product because we got it right.

17
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:26,920
So I will add a div here and in this different image and there I will output product image.

18
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,120
U r l datus the field in which you are storing the image.

19
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,230
Check your model in case you're not sure.

20
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:43,660
And as old text output product title now below the image I want to output to tag where I output my product

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:53,130
price like this and believe that a paragraph with my product description just like this.

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,600
So that is my detailed page there and if we now saved as we have to make sure that we render this view

23
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,690
for our detail route.

24
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:07,950
So in our controller where we do get this single product data instead of redirecting here I'll remove

25
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,070
that and instead of logging this to the console all say rest render.

26
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:19,390
And I want to render my view into a shop folder and there is the product Dasch detail view.

27
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:26,060
So basically the filename here product detail and we have to pass some information.

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,890
We do that by passing a javascript object and in there we now need to pass in a product property because

29
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,470
we're accessing this here in the view.

30
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,170
So back in our shop J follows.

31
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:45,870
Let's pass product and set this equal to our product.

32
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,520
We're retrieving your product on the right side of the colon is the product for retrieving product on

33
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,090
the left side is simply the key but which will be able to access it in the view.

34
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:05,340
That Let's save that and go back to product to load the details here and we get an error or that we're

35
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:12,390
missing the page title showing us which Linus following the error and old tells us page is not the find.

36
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:20,200
And this makes sense because in the head of our of each page we're outputting to page title here.

37
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,890
So we also have to pass that into our view.

38
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:29,400
So in shop JCR let's make sure we don't just pass the product but also the page title.

39
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:35,950
And here we can actually use product title to dynamically set the page title to the title of the product.

40
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:45,910
With that simply reload this page I'm also missing the POF now because in the navigation we're using

41
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,420
data to determine which path is active.

42
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,740
And now there the question is which path do we want to highlight in a navigation file here.

43
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:03,040
We obviously have no ports no link to this exact product but I think it makes sense to highlight the

44
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,920
products link here because we're still in the product area just in the detail for a single product.

45
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:16,900
If we want to highlight this the POF we should pass is slash products because that's the payoff We're

46
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,740
checking here.

47
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,010
So in shop.

48
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:19,620
Yes.

49
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:26,410
File said pove to slash products here because this is the POV for which I want to mark the navigation

50
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,680
item as active.

51
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,450
Now if we reload.

52
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,970
Does looks better.

53
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,820
And now this doesn't look too shabby.

54
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,060
We got a nice detail page here.

55
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,610
Does the trick for NL.

56
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:41,510
Let's maybe finish it up by adding add to cart button below the product.

57
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,050
But with that I'd say this is what we need for the moment.

58
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:52,130
So let's go back to our product detail Ejaz file and below all that information.

59
00:04:52,210 --> 00:05:01,890
I will now add a little forum which leads to cart with post request because I want to add that product

60
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:10,830
and I'll add a button with class button and type submit and the route for this is missing still where

61
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,560
I say Add to Cart.

62
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,230
And now if that if we reload we got that but you're too.

63
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,490
So this is now working.

64
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,140
And this is looking decent.

65
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,620
With that I'd say Why don't we work on that.

66
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,390
Add to card functionality as a nextstep.
