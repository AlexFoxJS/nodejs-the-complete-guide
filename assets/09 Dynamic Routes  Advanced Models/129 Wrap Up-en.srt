1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,790
So that's it for this module.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:11,610
Again we learned a lot and practice a lot you'll learn about dynamic routing and that you can pass dynamic

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,880
path segments by adding a colon to the Express route or path the named after the colon is then the name

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,810
by which you can extract the data on request parens as a side note.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,880
You can have more than one dynamic segment per route.

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,830
It is absolutely possible.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,350
You can also work with optional equerry parameters.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,300
These are the parameters you append with a questionmark at the end of your u r l and you can have multiple

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,570
ones separate with an ampersand and you can extract these values with request query and then the name

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,050
of your Param.

11
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:50,920
Now you don't need to register or name these parameters in your route registry.

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,570
You totally don't add them there.

13
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,840
You can just start extracting them but since they're optional You should also have a check in place

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,360
to see if that parameter was passed.

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,530
In case you are depending on it we all continued working on models and we added a cart model which only

16
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,590
holds static Moffats because we don't we create a card that often instead we just want to work with

17
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,780
the data storage behind it all the sodded you can interact between models.

18
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,160
For example delete a card item if a product is deleted.

19
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,260
But as I also mentioned towards the end of this module it's not that good if we only work with files

20
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,670
for data storage because accessing them is a bit slow to be honest.

21
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,430
And in general there are better options.

22
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,860
Most importantly of course databases.

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,010
So let's move on to how we can work with databases in a node express app in the next module.
