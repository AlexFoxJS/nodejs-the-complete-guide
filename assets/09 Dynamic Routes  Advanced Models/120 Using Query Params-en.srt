1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,500
We work that out on the cart model some things are still missing.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:12,670
For example we never display our card and we also never really we're not able to delete an item from

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,510
the card but let's ignore that for the moment.

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,240
Let's instead focus on editing a product.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,790
We've got the added product each as file and in the end what I want to do in there is I want to render

6
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,050
the same form I have for ad product.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:34,840
The difference will be that I want to create populate that form with the values of the product I want

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,390
to edit.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:45,070
Now if I'm using the same HDMI code in the end it would make sense to reuse the same template if you

10
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,750
ever plan on using a different one it doesn't but it makes sense.

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,910
So what I will do is I'll take my ADD product Ejaz code and move it into edit product because I find

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,580
this to be the more generic name and I'll delete the add product Ejaz file.

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,940
So now we just have added product each S with all the time code in there that we need.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,450
Now first of all that means that I have to load dat file in admin.

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:20,950
J.S. when we load get at product I no longer need the add product lbf I need added product here only

16
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:27,130
the part on there can stay at product because that is what we use for highlighting a certain navigation

17
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:33,160
item but a way we can get rid of these additional additional information pieces.

18
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,300
So now this should still work if I click on Add product.

19
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,260
I still see that form.

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,590
So that's looking good.

21
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:47,980
However for editing a product I now also want to have a route I don't want to use that same view so

22
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,140
I'll copy that route.

23
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:55,390
You're an added maybe below post at product to keep these two together.

24
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:04,780
And here I will have get added product as an acronym and I also want to render edit product here.

25
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,570
The difference is that here I plan on passing in my product information.

26
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:14,850
But the problem is of course how they reached as control or action.

27
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,240
And my idea is dead since I already have my edit button here.

28
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,050
If I clicked that I don't want to call added product like dis.

29
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,920
I also want to get the idea of the product I want added.

30
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,330
So if I grab a real ID from my products Jason fall like this one.

31
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,460
Then I would have data and you are all.

32
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:39,340
And if I load this now I want to have to form pre-populated with the data for this product and if I

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:46,370
hit the save button I of course don't want to create this product but simply edit the existing one now

34
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,820
this means that I need two things.

35
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:58,250
The idea I need to pass that and the information that I want to add is the product instead of created.

36
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,830
Well if we go to our admen routes we can add a new route.

37
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,510
First of all there's added product Routier with the ID and you'll learn how that works actually you

38
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,830
can add a new route to your route.

39
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:19,110
We'll be at slash and then here the slash Aben is available for all routes and the Edman Jaspal.

40
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,650
Anyways as you know so it's just added product.

41
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,900
And then the idea and again this is a variable.

42
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:33,710
A dynamic lbf segment indicated with a colon and then we can load the admin controller and there d get

43
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,710
added product.

44
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,260
Actually we just add it.

45
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,320
So this is step number one.

46
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,300
And actually we now already can go to our admen chase controller.

47
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,210
And here we obviously know that we want to added a product.

48
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:57,530
So what we can do is we can pass an additional information field to our view editing and that's true

49
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,040
maybe so that we can check with the if condition to find out.

50
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:07,070
For example if upon clicking that save button we should try to add the product and send a request to

51
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,020
that route or try to edit it and send it to a different route.

52
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:19,670
But let's say we want you get an additional confirmation by ensuring that people have to pass us a so-called

53
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:26,360
kukri parameter in the euro query parameter can be added to any you l by adding a question mark and

54
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,890
then a key value pair separated by an equal sign like edit equals truth.

55
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,400
And you can have multiple query parameters by separating and with and percents.

56
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:45,050
So we could all have title equals new for example.

57
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,460
So this is possible.

58
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,250
And this is so-called optional data.

59
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,930
The Here is a route which gets reached is determined by the part up to the questionmark.

60
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,640
So you don't need to add any information about query parameters.

61
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,960
You might get to your route's file these pauvres are not affected but you can.
