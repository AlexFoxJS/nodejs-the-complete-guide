1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,340
So let's start with registering the route's then.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:11,790
And for this I will go into the routes folder there we have admin and shop and this still sounds like

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,700
a decent differentiation.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,400
And let's start with the shop related routes.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,600
Right now we got the starting page.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,930
Now we will also need a Gach route for Slash products because if we have a look into our navigation

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:33,040
Ejaz file this is this new link which we added so slash products will also need slash cart because that's

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,870
another new link we have.

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,450
It will also be a Getaround and I will of course also add controller functions.

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:47,730
But I'll first define all the routes so all the neat slash cart and later I'll also need a route for

11
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,990
the checkout process.

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:55,290
So slash checkout is already something we can also add and obviously you are free to edit any of these

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,880
pauvres to your liking.

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,790
Just make sure today not just the links you might have in your application now.

15
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:10,220
Besides visiting slash products we will also need a single product and that will then actually contain

16
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,530
some new logic to which I will come back.

17
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,980
So let's stick to these general routes for now.

18
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,980
Of course we all need more than just to shop around.

19
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,580
We also got some Edman routes in and navigation for example.

20
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:26,210
We got the new admin products here and then we'll also need a route for editing.

21
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,540
We'll at this later and we're deleting all also something I'll add later.

22
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,290
So for now let's simply go to Edman J.S. and there I will add.

23
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:40,710
And you get route because I want to load a new page and there will just be slash products now.

24
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:47,730
Never forget this is Justice Roberts also already in a POV that starts with Slash admen.

25
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:54,410
Because this is what we filter for in J S and of course we'll also need a controller function for that.

26
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,000
OK.

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,190
So this is looking good.

28
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,600
Now how about the controllers.

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,460
Now we can follow different approaches there.

30
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,800
Obviously most of the things we have are still related to products but we also got some new routes like

31
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,420
card or check out.

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,710
And later we'll also add orders for example.

33
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,270
So we got that.

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,740
Now these are implicitly Of course related to products right.

35
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,630
We do buy products in the end.

36
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:28,100
But we could also argue that semantically or from a logic perspective they rather belong to the general

37
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,980
shop idea.

38
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:38,450
So now we might be back to actually using a shop controller and a new admin controller so that we can

39
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,330
split our logic by these two sections.

40
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,820
Alternatively you could of course think about using a product's controller and a shop controller and

41
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:52,160
have everything related to products only in the products controller and things like card and check out

42
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,690
in the shop controller.

43
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,440
But I will go for this setup.

44
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:03,020
Now that of course means that my two admin related drought's get at product and post at product should

45
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,470
be removed from the shop.

46
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,850
Yes file and go into the admin J.S. file.

47
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,440
This makes more sense.

48
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,690
I will also need my model here though.

49
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,950
So let's take data import and also add it here in the Edmond J.S. file.

50
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,380
This has implications for my routes because the admin routes.

51
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,620
I'm still importing to shop controller.

52
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:31,740
Well this should now become the admin controller and therefore I should also rename it to admin control

53
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:38,610
or appear and then replace it down there and a similar thing needs to be done in the shop js file in

54
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,830
the route's folder.

55
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:48,120
Dare we import shop controller which is good but I should name it shop controller then and then of course

56
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,350
also replace dat.

57
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,260
So it looks a bit cleaner to me.

58
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:58,630
And with that we can now also hook up our routes it is of course the first of all need to add them though.

59
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:08,390
So let's start with shopkeepers and their exports a new page and that should be my get index function

60
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,000
here are there.

61
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:19,040
I want to render the index page so I will get my middleware function here and in there of course I also

62
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,010
want to fetch some products and render a view.

63
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,110
For now I will therefore simply copy the logic from get products.

64
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,870
So for now the two pages are the same but I will render shop index here.

65
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,890
So using that index page view here.

66
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,590
And even if we have the same product on there we can of course work on the view and show a different

67
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,540
starting text there for the starting page.

68
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,020
Anything like dead.

69
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,510
OK now we got get index and get products and if we go to the route's file.

70
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:55,580
This means that for Slash anything I actually want to load it get index function.

71
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:01,580
Here in my controller because that is the starting page and it's for Slash products that I want to load

72
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,640
get products instead.

73
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:10,010
We all need to load the cart and check out pages and therefore let's go back to the shop controller

74
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,480
and there we got to get the index and get products.

75
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:23,440
I will export something you and that will be get cart and there again request response next is what

76
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,450
I have here.

77
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:35,460
And it will render a new view here and that view will be shop slash cart pointing at the cart Ejay as

78
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,390
file in the shop folder and it will pass some data to it.

79
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:45,800
For example I need to set the POF to slash cart byte away for product list here.

80
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:51,940
I also need to set it to slash products because that is the path we're checking for in the navigation.

81
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,480
We can also change the title here maybe to all products and on the starting page.

82
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,510
I leave it at shop.

83
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,920
I pass the products both view.

84
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,520
I don't need that code anymore.

85
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,000
That is a list we have we have from the handlebars times.

86
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,690
We don't need dead so we can remove that.

87
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,330
Now for the card view.

88
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:21,250
I will therefore also add a page title and there I will simply say your cart and that is it for now

89
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,760
later will also add or load the cart items.

90
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,940
But let's not focus on that for the moment.

91
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,240
Last but not least let's load it check out page with get checked out.

92
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:38,840
And there we have a request response and next year idon also render a view.

93
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,110
The view here is shop check out.

94
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:48,270
And then we need to pass some data where I set the POF to slash checkout and where I also set the page

95
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:53,430
title to checkout so that all our views get the data they should need.

96
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,930
Now that's looking good.

97
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,860
Let's go back to the shop yes file in the Ross folder then and there we can use these new routes for

98
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,930
the cart route.

99
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:10,970
We can use shop control or get cart and for checkout we can use shop control or get checkout the two

100
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,810
new controller functions we created.

101
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,470
Now we're almost done with the controllers and the routes at least the basic set up.

102
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:24,890
Let's now go to Edmund J S and there we also have 1 route products.

103
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:30,540
So let's go to the Edmond J S and the US folder and there I will add a new route.

104
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:40,380
Exports get products is my normal middleware function and here I basically want to do the same as I

105
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,260
do and get products in a shop here.

106
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:49,740
I simply want to fetch all products and then render my view so I will copy that code go to admen J.S.

107
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,730
and put that into this route.

108
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,770
Fettled products but of course then render a different view.

109
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,650
I want to render adman's slash products.

110
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,110
So this view here should be rendered.

111
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,230
I will also named admen products.

112
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:13,160
And the payoff will be slash admen slash products to market that correctly in the navigation with all

113
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,730
that set up.

114
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:19,240
If we go back and reload we see a white page which is a good sign because it's not an error.

115
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:26,300
And we do see a white page because actually for a slash nothing which just a of time on here we load

116
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,170
or we execute get indexed in the shop controller.

117
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:36,020
And this actually yields us shop index which happens to be an empty Ejay view.

118
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,860
So therefore we see an empty page.

119
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,150
Makes sense.

120
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,150
Let's take the code from product list each class and copy it into index Aegeus.

121
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:51,770
And if we leave it as it is and we reload we now see sharp we see the products the same is the case

122
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,430
for the products page because they share the same code for now.

123
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,220
Card is empty again.

124
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,840
And therefore we should add some content there to at least we should include the head and the navigation

125
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,570
so that we see something.

126
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,710
So let's go to card Aegeus and add that include of the hat.

127
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,430
We don't need product C S here for now.

128
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:20,010
We got the body start and then we get the navigation and then lets simply alter add and Ejaz so that

129
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,030
we have a valid HTL document.

130
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:30,470
With that added If I reload this Routier we all see cart with nothing on at product should still work

131
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:34,930
and admen products won't work let's copy the code from card ha ass.

132
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,120
And let's head over to products in the admin folder in the views folder pasted in there so that we at

133
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,140
least see that they offer an outlook on admin products.

134
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:50,990
It looks like it tries to render the 4 0 4 page but has an error there.

135
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,540
Now that means two things.

136
00:09:52,580 --> 00:10:00,150
For a one hour route seems to be wrong in Edmund Jason orality folder slash products should be right.

137
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,150
Yeah but I'm.

138
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,640
I didn't hook up my admin controller dare so we should add admin control to get products here in Edmond

139
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:13,430
J s and to route's folder and on the other hand also on four or four page had an issue because dare

140
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,340
we see that the payoff is not the find.

141
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:24,610
So what I'm missing here is that for my 4 0 4 a controller error control to be precise.

142
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:31,070
I also need to add a payoff here because I try to extract that pop in my navigation and therefore I

143
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,330
also should set up half year and I can set that to slash for 0 4.

144
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,490
Doesn't really matter.

145
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,890
It just needs to be there.

146
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,700
So now reloading works because that's admen products.

147
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,600
But now even an unknown route will work again.

148
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,890
So this is looking good.
