1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:09,010
Time for more logic and with which logic do we want to start we could add more logic to product for

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:15,850
example so that we finally can not just add a title but actually also an image a prize and a description

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,830
texture.

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,430
So to do that first of all I'll work on my model here in this model.

5
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:29,290
I want to make sure that we don't just work with the title here but that I actually initialize a new

6
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:34,750
product with my title and I will now rename it here as an argument.

7
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,550
You probably got the point that these two names don't have to be equal but it's easier to understand

8
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,750
the constructor if we give it a title that makes sense or a name that makes sense.

9
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:49,110
So I got my timelier now a product will also have an image you are.

10
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,580
Later in the course we'll also add image upload.

11
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,050
For now let's take a finished.

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,250
You are of some image on the web.

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,470
It also needs a description and a price.

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,610
And that year I will simply store all that data in properties.

15
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,060
Image you are l will be stored.

16
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:12,690
The description will be stored and the price will be stored.

17
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,270
Not description price like this.

18
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,930
With all that future products we add to our file.

19
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,420
We'll have all that data in them and data we fetch or products we fetch will have to.

20
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,600
Now we just need to work on our ad product view and make sure we've got more inputs to fetch and additional

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,460
data.

22
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,630
And for this let's simply copied that form control and add an additional 1 were fetching the title.

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:46,150
Now as we just worked on the model we'll also need an image you are el and all simply fetch this as

24
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,360
some text input for it out again will add an image upload later in the course.

25
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,520
So here I will get my image.

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,680
You are all name that field image you are l and optionally also assign an ID.

27
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,990
Your FOR BEST accessibility.

28
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:10,930
Now I'll copy that again and here I will not add input but instead here I want to fetch the description.

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,520
Or let's actually fetch the price first so it stays in input actually.

30
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,600
And here I want to have a price.

31
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:25,260
Notice can be of type number and I will give this year an idea of price and also a name of price.

32
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:30,000
And now I will add one more form control and that should be my description.

33
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,740
So here this is for my description for the element with the description ID.

34
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,660
It gets the label description and now this is not an input.

35
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:48,730
Instead it is a text area and data text area has a name or description and an ID or description and

36
00:02:48,790 --> 00:03:00,390
it also has let's say 5 Rozier if we add all that and we go to add product does the form we see doesn't

37
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,400
look too bad but the description field doesn't look good.

38
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:09,640
Well that is a styling thing and we can quickly fix that in the public folder by going to forums.

39
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,410
Us.

40
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,830
I want to give it the same styling as a normal input has.

41
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:20,640
So here where I have form control input that's add form control text area with a white space in between

42
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,690
and that's all the ads that rule or that selector for this rule here.

43
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:33,570
And also down there for this rule I will add text area and then the focus pseudos elector.

44
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,920
And with that if we now reload this looks much better.

45
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,050
So now we got all these fields here which we need to add a product.

46
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:47,700
And these are automatically added to the request which is sent to the backend because we are using regular

47
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,520
h m l inputs in a form and we assigned names.

48
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,230
So now we can extract all that data up by the names we assign to our input fields here.

49
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:05,280
And with that let's actually go back to our controller to the admin controller where we have post ad

50
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,550
product and then we create a new product.

51
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,230
I do extract a title here.

52
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,590
Now let's do this in a more structured way to make it easier to read.

53
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,430
I do extract my title here and store it in a constant tidal constant because I never overwrite the value

54
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,030
in this function.

55
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,230
I will then also add my image you are l which I extract from request.

56
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,390
Body image you are l.

57
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:34,190
Now make sure to type this in exactly the same way using the same casing as you assigned to name your

58
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,360
and the same is true for the price and that description.

59
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,580
So here also at a price field and extract the prize.

60
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,840
And of course also extract my description.

61
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,320
And now with that data extracted here we can pass the title.

62
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:59,720
We can pass the image your L we can pass the description which to order you to find in the constructor

63
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,230
and we can pass the price.

64
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:06,370
And now we create a product with all that data.

65
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:13,460
Now if that next that let's also extract that data and show it when we show all products.
