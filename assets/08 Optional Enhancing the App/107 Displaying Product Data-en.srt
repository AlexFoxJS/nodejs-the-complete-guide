1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,720
We're now storing the product with all the data we need now we should also display all that real data

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,110
and don't show any dummy data anymore.

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:17,630
So for that let's go to our product list each last fall which is one of the views where we do display

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:23,670
all products and there we already output a real product title but that's it.

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,970
The image source for example is something we should not also replace.

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:35,240
And we can simply add our each day as expression in there an output image you are l and this will be

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,720
a string that should be valid.

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,410
You are sort of Shippy displayable.

9
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,460
Now for the alternative text we can also use deep tiles again.

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,490
So I simply copied each S-expression up there for a price.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,660
Let's say it's always dollars.

12
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:59,520
So we'll keep that dollar sign your as hard coded text and then output product price and forward a description

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,060
here.

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:09,070
I will of course also replace the dummy text with my description as it is saved in the product.

15
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,330
Now all old products will not fulfill this new structure.

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:21,420
So in the data folder in products Jason I will actually remove them all from that array here so that

17
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,880
it's an empty array again.

18
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,220
With that back end product list is looking good.

19
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,010
Now in index EJA as we have the same logic.

20
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:34,850
So we can simply copy that and back in index Ejaz simply replace it.

21
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:42,600
Now if I reload my app on shop and product we got no products but if I add a new one this is a test

22
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:51,300
product or simply book let's search an image I picked you are here and inserted here.

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,290
Then let's add a price 1999.

24
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,800
And this is an awesome book.

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,610
Sounds like a good title.

26
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:07,920
Now you can press add products and right now this does not support decimal numbers to fix this.

27
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,420
We can change something in the product view there on that number input.

28
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,110
We simply have to add a step attribute and set to step to see that Cyril one.

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,080
This means you can have well two decimal places essentially and increment in this step size.

30
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,890
I'll save this but not reload.

31
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:33,070
For now I'll simply go with the number without decimal places to not lose my data and hit add product.

32
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:39,430
And indeed on the starting page it's now showing this product with all the data I entered.

33
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,250
So now we improved that and we made a major step forward.

34
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,500
Therefore on both pages obviously we see it.

35
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:53,220
Let's now of course also work on making sure that as an admin We all see the products here.

36
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,800
And we dared not just see them but we can also edit or delete them.

37
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,750
That will be the next step.
