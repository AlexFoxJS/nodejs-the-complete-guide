1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,810
So back in code let's quickly think about our project.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,410
In the end what we're building here is an online shop.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,570
So what we need is a starting page.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,890
We need a page where we can do all the products that are listed.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:26,110
We also want to be able to create new products to added products as administrator also to delete products.

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:34,030
We want to be able to add products to a shopping cart to go to a check out page and pay for the products

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,000
and then also as a customer we want to be able to see our orders.

8
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:45,090
So that's a lot of stuff and we'll build all that logic for the course but we can already get started.

9
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,410
And for that I will get started in the views and I'll try to add the views for the different things

10
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,470
we'll need.

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,950
Get at product and shop each day asks us for now.

12
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,780
Let's add more views here.

13
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,580
And I will also split them in some folders to group them together basically.

14
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:09,340
I will add admen subfolder and I'll move to add product view into the Edmond's subfolder for example.

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,670
I'll also add another subfolder and that will be my shop.

16
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,040
So does this the customer facing part.

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:23,460
You could say and then I'll have my shop Ejay last fall though I will renamed as to product list Ejaz

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,930
because that is what I want to have on this page in the end.

19
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,710
It should be a page with a list of all my products.

20
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:35,260
Now this of course is not a complete list of all of views but we already need to add some changes.

21
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:43,000
As I restructured the folder structure here forward a product list for example for my includes this

22
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,970
POV is not correct anymore.

23
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,140
Product list is now in a shop subfolder.

24
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,850
So first of all the two go up one level until I can dive into the includes folder.

25
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:00,430
So here in that pop we should have dot dot slash which means up one level and to say I'm here for my

26
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,130
navigation.

27
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,000
So all that should be done.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,070
And also for.

29
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:14,280
And E.J. last year and of course the same for ad product there dare you want to go up one level you're

30
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,400
also up one level and down there up one level with this adjusted it.

31
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:27,670
We also need to make sure that we render to correct use because our controller products controller we

32
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,220
return the shop view.

33
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,720
But this is seen relative from inside the views folder.

34
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:41,720
However first of all we renamed this to product list and second it's now in a subfolder named shop.

35
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:49,870
So actually we have to go into shop and then slash product list desists a new path to our view and the

36
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,020
same here for ad product admen ad product here.

37
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,140
This is now in the adman's subfolder.

38
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:02,530
So we should go into the admin folder and then render ad product with these changes in place if I reload

39
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,690
my page here.

40
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,160
This should all still work.

41
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,160
And indeed I can still switch.

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,880
So the existing views are rendered correctly.

43
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,820
So that seems to work.

44
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:17,760
Now we can add more to use here and forget in the shop for example I'll have an index page.

45
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,430
So the starting page basically.

46
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,300
Right now this is my product list.

47
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,800
Well I will add a new area the products area which should rendered product list and the starting page

48
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,360
should be a different page.

49
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,130
And in the end it will be very similar but it should display less products.

50
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:40,870
Let's say now in the shop I also want to have a product detail that E.J. asked view where if I click

51
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,350
on a product I can see that and I want to have a card.

52
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:51,250
E.J. s view which I can basically see if I click on the card in the menu and we'll have to add this

53
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,820
menu item of course.

54
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:59,540
And there's one remaining for now and that is my check out each s view which will be the check outflow

55
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,070
which we can start from inside the cart.

56
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,020
Now in the Edmond area we got at product.

57
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,900
I also will add added product thought E.J. so that we can do that too.

58
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:17,470
And I will also add my list or product list don't Ejaz view.

59
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,900
Now we got a product list view already in the shop area.

60
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,790
The admin of course also needs to be able to see that.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,930
And just to avoid name clashes or confusion you could name it like this wouldn't be a problem.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,360
But to not confuse you when I referred to these views I'll name it products e.g. SNB Edman area and

63
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,060
product list in the shop area.

64
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,970
But you could absolutely use the same name because they are in different folders.

65
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,830
So now we got that set up and we'll add more if we need more.

66
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,560
But that looks decent.

67
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:56,670
Now let's go to the navigation and there I also need to work on the way level navigation items because

68
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:04,680
right now if I structured is a bit different to make it easier to read like this we get to navigation

69
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,050
items one for the starting page and one for adding a product in the admin area.

70
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:16,710
Now of course you could argue that you in general don't want one navigation with all the normal customer

71
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,090
options and all the admin options but that is something we can tackle later.

72
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:28,710
For now in the next lecture I want to continue working on this and add all the links to all my views.

73
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,480
For the moment so that we can then refine those from the course.
