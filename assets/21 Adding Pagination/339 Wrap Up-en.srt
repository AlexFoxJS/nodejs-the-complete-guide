1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,650
So now we edit page nation to our application.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,840
And of course you can now tweet us adjusted to your needs.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:15,980
Change the items per page you want to display For example if you switched to and you reload you won't

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,740
find items on page 4 but you will find items on page 1.

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:26,840
And now you got all that logic in place that should allow you to display the data you want to display

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,220
and to not fetch all the data in one go.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,470
And it's important for you to understand that since find uses a cursor.

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,700
It does only retrieve the items you need to count documents does not retrieve all.

9
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:43,130
It only counts them which is fostered and retrieving them and skip and limit all manage.

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,010
Or are managed by man would you be in a way that you only transferred the items overdue wire which you

11
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:49,630
really need.

12
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,980
So does this not doing some server side filtering of the data every filter set on the database server

13
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,050
already.

14
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,230
So this is how you can add pagination to your node express application.
