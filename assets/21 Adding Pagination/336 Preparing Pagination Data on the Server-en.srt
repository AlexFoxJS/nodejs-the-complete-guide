1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:08,900
We are able to skip and limit the amount of items we fetch and we can't control that with Kuri parameters.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,840
But my buttons are hard coded right now and that is not ideal of course.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,610
Instead it robber one to you maybe highlight the page I'm currently on and then show the next page number

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,180
or previous page number Florida's.

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,340
I need to fetch more information.

6
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:34,060
I will find by products and call count here and I can also add then and catch.

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,080
The important thing is I don't need catch because I'll concatenate my promised change later.

8
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,920
The important thing here is discipline now not to read all the products but simply just a number.

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:50,770
So a number of products is what I get back into a van block function year and in that function I don't

10
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:59,450
want to kick off my request where I really do fetch all the data so will return product find in here.

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,860
With Skip and limit change after it that's important.

12
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,560
And then I'll add.

13
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,050
Then block to continue.

14
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:13,520
So first of all find to count then I have this number of products here and then I kick off my normal

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,900
find method where I don't really fetch the items and I skip and limit them here.

16
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:33,390
I'll add a variable total items and all set total items equal to name products in here.

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,440
So now I will have the total number of products stored in that variable here and what I render the index

18
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,250
page.

19
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:49,790
Then I want to return that information as well so not just the products but also total products and

20
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:57,190
that will be total items so that will be a number in the end and also once you pass the information

21
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:03,850
wherever there is a next page so maybe Ahaz next page which only will be the case if the total number

22
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,690
of items is greater than the page we are on.

23
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,260
Times the items per page.

24
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,960
So we have a next page.

25
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:19,360
If items per page Times page is smaller than total items because if we have 10 total items and we are

26
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,950
on page 4 then we have 2 times for 8 items which we are seeing or which we saw.

27
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,190
We have 10 left so there will be a next page simultaneously.

28
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:37,690
I can add has a previous page here where I can simply return the information whether the current page

29
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,490
is greater than 1.

30
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,520
If that is true then there is this page because there will be page one that is false because we are

31
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,550
on page one already.

32
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,220
Well then there is no previous page because we can't go lower than one.

33
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:57,170
I can also return some extra information like the next page and that will be Page Plus one of course

34
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:05,390
if we are on page 1 the next page would be page 2 and previous page would be page minus one.

35
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:17,140
Obviously we can also add last page to have a way of displaying the highest page number that is Marth

36
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,880
seal.

37
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,270
Total items divided by items per page.

38
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:31,670
So if we have let's say 11 total items and we have items per page or to then the result would be 5 dot

39
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,910
5 and then Moff seal would return us 6 which would be the correct value because we would need 6 pages

40
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,920
to display all 11 items.

41
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,060
If we show 2 items per page so not passing all that information to my products page to my index page

42
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,970
here to be precise and there I now want to use it.
