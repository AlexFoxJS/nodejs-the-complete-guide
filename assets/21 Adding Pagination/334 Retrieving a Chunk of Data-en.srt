1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:08,250
I'm setting these query parameters and I can use that data on the back end to control which data I want

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,150
to fetch.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,540
Obviously I do that in my controllers and they're in the shop controller here.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,500
We're working on the index page so I'm looking for to get index controller action in here I need to

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,050
retrieve the information on which page we are.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,040
So which data for which page needs to be displayed.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,180
So I'll store this information in a new constant named page and then that constant will I will store

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,160
request and then we can get query parameters on the query object provided by express.

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:44,150
And there I can access page page because I named that query Ravager page here.

10
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,350
So now with that I'm getting at page number and I'll store it in this constant.

11
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,400
Now with that we just need to define how many items should be displayed per page.

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,000
And that's something I will store as a global constant in this file.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,250
I could also store it in a different file export there and import to here.

14
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,180
But I will.

15
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,970
Named is items per page.

16
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,880
And this will be let's say 2.

17
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:16,400
It should be some number lowered and the number of items you have here so that you can see a difference.

18
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:23,250
So I have two items per page here and with that and get index.

19
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,960
I know that I if I'm on page 1 want to fetch the first two items.

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,600
If I'm on page two I want to fetch items free and for on page free it would fetch four and 5 and so

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,740
on.

22
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,590
Therefore we now need to control the amount of data we're retrieving from the database find right now

23
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,870
gives us all the items but we can actually control this in Mongolia.

24
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,540
And they offer also mongooses.

25
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:57,150
There is a skip function we can add this on a cursor and find does return a cursor to skip the first

26
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,950
X amount of results and here that would be page minus 1.

27
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:10,930
So the previous page number in brackets times items per page.

28
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:18,920
So if I am on page 2 I would skip the first page minus one sort of first one times items per page items.

29
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:27,090
So on page 2 if I have 2 items per page I would skip the first one times to the first two items.

30
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,220
I don't just want to skip some items.

31
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,460
I also want to limit the amount of items I retrieved though so that I don't just skipped the items of

32
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:42,850
previous pages but for the current page I also only fetch as many items as I want to display there and

33
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,230
this can be done with the limit method.

34
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,800
The limit method as the names of gests limits the amount of data we fetch to.

35
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:56,800
Well number we specify here and here I can pass items per page because that is my item limit per page

36
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,630
with debt if we save as quote We can reload the first page with the query parameter set to page 1 and

37
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,790
we only see the first two items.

38
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,350
If I now click on two down there I only see the third item because I'm on page 2.

39
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,480
I skip the first two items and then fetch the next two items and I only happened to have one other item

40
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:24,010
on page 3 if I would enter this we would not find any products because I have no items for this page

41
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,620
but Page 1 and 2 were just fine.

42
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,460
So does is the general idea behind page anation.

43
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,950
Now obviously the idea would be dead.

44
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:41,770
We update our page anation buttons here based on well the page we are on and the maximum number of pages

45
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,700
that are available or something like that.

46
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,970
So let's see what we can do.

47
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,260
There.
