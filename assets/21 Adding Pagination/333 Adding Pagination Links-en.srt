1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:09,460
Here's our shop and I created free products behind the scenes so you can of course create any free products

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,290
on one or more user accounts does matter and you will have free products.

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,580
Now obviously we can absolutely displayed these free products like this.

4
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,680
Nothing wrong with that but let's say we have hundreds of products.

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,900
We would not want to display all these products on one page.

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:32,440
Instead we'd like to split them across multiple pages and then somewhere on the page off at the bottom

7
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:38,390
we'd have some controls to go to page one page to the next or the previous page.

8
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,720
And that is exactly what I want to implement here.

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,870
Page anation.

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,180
Now you can certainly find some third party packages that can help you with that.

11
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:52,240
And these would be fine to use but I will show you how to implement that from scratch on your own because

12
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,060
that is obviously how you learn the most.

13
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,240
So back in our project how can we implement page.

14
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,660
Well typically you handle this.

15
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,440
As I said by adding some controls which always leads to the same payoff.

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,670
So always slash products or slash.

17
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,390
Nothing.

18
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:16,730
But then you add a curry parameter remembered query Ravagers are these parameters you add after a questionmark

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,480
which allow you to specify optional data and you could specify something like page equals one to load

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:29,570
the first page or page equal to to load the second page and you would change these parameters with these

21
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,830
controls you add.

22
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,570
Let me show you what I mean.

23
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,390
I will go into my views folder and let's work on that slash so on that route route.

24
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:45,130
So that index each fall here and there at the bottom beneath my products.

25
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:52,040
But inside of that first if block so where I that I have some products in there I'll add a new section.

26
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,230
I'll give it a class of page nation because this will be the section where I managed page nation.

27
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,780
And my idea is to have a link here which says 1 for Page 1 and 2 for Page 2.

28
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,850
And here I would go to slash and have page equal to one let's say and here Page equal to two.

29
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:14,200
So here it would set a creeper amateur to value one or respectively to value two.

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,610
If I save it as and reload we can see that on the left here.

31
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,480
Now let's change the styling real quick.

32
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:30,660
So for that I'll go into my public folder SEUS S&amp;M to main Zia's as fall and I'll scroll all the way

33
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,570
to the bottom right before that at me Ikari I'll add page nation so that colossi I added to the section

34
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,890
and I'll set text align to center and I'll also Stollman links.

35
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:47,910
This is of course totally optional but I will Stolle my anchor text in there to have no text decoration.

36
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,510
So to not be underlined I'll give them a color of let's say my green which I'm using in this project

37
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:03,810
I will also add some padding of let's say 5 REM and give them a border of one pixel solid and that same

38
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:10,360
green color and all the same margin of one gram left and right.

39
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,620
Something like this if I knew I was safe that I have these buttons here.

40
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:23,630
Now one more thing on the whole page nations sectional at a march and top off to REM and I also want

41
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:31,180
to make sure my buttons have some hover style so page anation a habere and Page nation a.

42
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:37,990
Active sets dishtowels when I hover over them or when I click on them and there I will set a background

43
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,090
of this green color and change the text color to white.

44
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,640
Now does this all optional.

45
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,860
I just want to have some styling here for my buttons.

46
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,940
So now we have these buttons and if I click one of them you can see you are l changes.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,400
It's the same path just slash nothing but I have an optional parameter in there.

48
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:04,910
Now with that set up here let's now see how we can work with that parameter on the back end to control

49
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,290
the data we are fetching.
