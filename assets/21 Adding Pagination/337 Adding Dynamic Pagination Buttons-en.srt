1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:09,990
So let's now use all that information we get back from our back end when rendering our index Ejaz page

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:16,290
we have all these utility information pieces is still the variables like total products has next page

3
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:20,720
and so on which hopefully should be helpful.

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,090
So let's go back to index.

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:22,640
Yes.

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:28,980
And there instead of hard coding this we can now generate this dynamically.

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,940
Now I always want to have page one here that is something I absolutely need.

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,950
Let's say the page next to it should be the current page.

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,280
So actually Eva instead of total products I should return current page year which is simply the page

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,760
number so that I always know what's the currently active page and returning current page as well.

11
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:57,140
And here I can output equals current page because I'm now getting that data in my view.

12
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:02,780
And here I will load the current page number if I should click on that link again.

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,860
And this current page will receive a c is S class of active because that will always be the active class

14
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:16,550
and I'll quickly go to my main areas as fall to give that the same style as when I hover over it.

15
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:23,080
So here I'll have my page anation a class with an act class added to it with a single dot A that will

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,550
receive the same style as when I hover over it.

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,170
Now I only want to render this one byte away if dickered page is not one because otherwise it will already

18
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:41,500
rendered here so we can add some Ejaz logic here to check if current page is equal to one or to be precise

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,660
if that is not the case.

20
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,660
If that is not the case

21
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,560
then I will render this otherwise it will not rendered this so I can now close that.

22
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,270
Now this will only get rendered if the current page is not equal to one like this.

23
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,290
Does will always get rendered to current page.

24
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,540
And I also want to render the next page.

25
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:13,690
Let's say so I will repeat this one more time here and this will be the next page.

26
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,140
Remember the next page is some information which I return as well.

27
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:24,080
Next page here so will render the next page only However if there is a next page and that is a number

28
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,350
piece of information I do return has next page.

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:39,290
So let me go back and here again if has the next page so if that is true then I will render this otherwise

30
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,890
I won't.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,910
So here I just close that if statement.

32
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:49,750
I also want to render the highest page so I'll add another anchor.

33
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,670
Here and that will justis last page information.

34
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,750
By the way the act of kloshe of course not be Editor at all and not be editor here.

35
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,530
So hearable rendered a last page and it leads lead to last page here.

36
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,150
It will lead to next page by the ways and we have to adjust this link.

37
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,160
Obviously here it's the last page

38
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:29,440
and this last page should also not always be rendered it should only be rendered if last page is not

39
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,520
equal to the current page.

40
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,970
So if we are not already on the current page because then this link would already rendered a link to

41
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:43,870
this last page and the next page should all not be equal to the last page because if it is then this

42
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,180
link will already be rendered.

43
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,420
And does this then the last and next page simul tenuously.

44
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:54,620
But if both is not true then I will render this.

45
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,180
Now let's have a look at this.

46
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:06,250
And let's reload this and here the error little logical error count used to be the function you should

47
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:06,520
use.

48
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,290
Now it's count documents.

49
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,170
So change counts to count documents here.

50
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,180
But does Erris not coming from that.

51
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:19,940
And in this case here I got a dollar sign instead of a percentage sign which I should use.

52
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,220
With that fixed does looks better.

53
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,710
But I got 11 here and then got you again.

54
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,550
So there seemed to be some issues.

55
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,040
For one it's rendering.

56
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,890
The one here even though the current page is not equal to one.

57
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,620
The problem here is really just the data format.

58
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,290
We're comparing strings and numbers here.

59
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,480
So I should remove one equals sign.

60
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,020
And now this works.

61
00:04:50,100 --> 00:05:00,780
And now regarding the 11 next page somehow is calculated to be 11.

62
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:07,900
The reason for data is that page here is a string not a number and therefore page plus one gets concatenated

63
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,310
to 1 1 so to 11.

64
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:19,220
This can be fixed by adding up Lussier in front of request queries page.

65
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,860
And now does looks better.

66
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:26,860
Now I can switch between these two and does is looking all right now with that error or does format

67
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,110
this data type error fixed.

68
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:34,870
Now what happens if I load that page without the page Corre parameter that I have does not a number

69
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,700
issue here.

70
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,120
And to fix this I can add two pipe symbols here in that one.

71
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:47,340
And this means if this is undefined or if this does not hold a true ish value then we'll use disvalue

72
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,480
instead with that if I saved it

73
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,520
and I reload this page I'll start on page 1.

74
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,940
And now I can jump around.

75
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,180
Now let's try this.

76
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,060
When changing the items per page to one Soledad we should have one extra page.

77
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:12,850
Now if I reload this with Page 1 be loaded I can go to page 3 and one two three.

78
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,870
Now I don't see a two when I'm on page free because we have no logic for it and our template right now

79
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:26,060
I could of course add that logic to all the showed a previous page for that I can replicate this and

80
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,690
if I have a previous page

81
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,870
then I can show my previous page and link to it here.

82
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,720
Now of course I want to know what did I have to wonder if I'm on page 2 because that would render dis

83
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,920
link and that would render this link.

84
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:51,810
So I don't want to render this first page if I am on it already or if it's equal to the previous page.

85
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,710
So I only want to render this first page.

86
00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:06,570
If it's not equal to the current page and if the previous page is not equal to 1 now by the way since

87
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:13,610
I fixed that data type we can also work with double equal science here again it's not very low at this

88
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,910
page.

89
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,090
It's in the wrong place the previous page here should be before.

90
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,900
Does current page let's fix that.

91
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,040
Reload again.

92
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,210
Now it is looking better.

93
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:32,580
Now I can go to page to page one and that all seems to work.

94
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:42,650
Now let's add another product product for with another deck again to see how it works with four products

95
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,950
on the shop page.

96
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:49,970
And now I see the first page the next page and the last page to go to the last page I.S. to previous

97
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,480
page and the first page.

98
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,540
If I go to free will then I have the previous and the next page which is the last page and the first

99
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,110
page.

100
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:02,120
So now this page nation is working and you can always of course tweak this to your requirements or your

101
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,080
different needs.

102
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,400
But now this is looking good to me here.
