1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:09,870
So serving images statically is fine but we don't want to serve only images or only public files.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,280
I want to serve an invoice and that unwise should only be available to me.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,040
Now for that let's start with a dummy in was and I'll create a new folder for that.

4
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,840
All Nemat invoices.

5
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,520
You could of course put all motors and invoices ends on into a parent folder like data to not have them

6
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,400
all as root level folders.

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,960
That might be something you want to do on move the invoices and their images is kind of like a special

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,680
case but my private data should be maybe somewhere else.

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,970
So I'll put it into the data folder which was redundant until now.

10
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,140
Now it's not anymore.

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,090
And I prepared a simple PTF which I'll move in there.

12
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,780
Now this is a really simple PDA.

13
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,310
You can write it on your own.

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,540
It's just holding some text looking like this.

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,500
So here is my NYS that has to be diethyl I'm serving now.

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,870
Later we'll also generate this dynamically.

17
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,990
Now we won't.

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,060
Now I just want to show you how to surf it.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:17,400
Now obviously we could make our in folder here statically accessible but that's not what I want to do.

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,440
Now first of all let me work on the orders view to make sure we have a link to get that invoice.

21
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:31,460
So for each order this list item here which we have let's maybe add a dash and a list item and in there

22
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:38,210
let's add an anchor TAC which says invoice and then it should be pointing at the invoice.

23
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,310
So now if we reload this page we have in Y's here as a link.

24
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,950
Now I want to be able to click this and download the invoice.

25
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,990
How can we do that.

26
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:55,190
Well since I want to handle this privately I need to set up my own route for working within Wise's because

27
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,480
that will then allow me to check for things like user authenticated and so on.

28
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:06,060
So let me go to the route's folder and in there under.

29
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:14,160
Shop because it is a customer feature not admin related under shop here I'll add a new route.

30
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,720
Orders.

31
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:25,150
And then maybe NYS ID or order Id maybe because deep in ways that say we'll have a name of that order

32
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,530
idea.

33
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,210
Ultimately

34
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:34,400
we could name does fall differently we can name it invoice and then let me quickly up look up my order

35
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,280
ID to make this all work correctly.

36
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:46,150
Got a bunch of orders in there but this is my latest order order which I just placed the let's grab

37
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,470
that text idea here.

38
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,350
And and add that to the invoice name here.

39
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,400
Maybe after a dash we have the order I'd use something like this.

40
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:04,880
So this is my end was and I'm getting the order ID in this route I should be protected authenticated

41
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,530
to see that's all protect this route and then I'll use my shop controller and there I get in wise control

42
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,800
or action which I have yet to at.

43
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,120
So that's why I've crashed here because I don't have that action yet.

44
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:24,620
In the shop controller bought bottom maybe let's exports get in twice a year and that will be our default

45
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,070
middleware function with request response and next.

46
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,330
And in here I now want to return that file.

47
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:41,950
First of all I need the wise idea for that order ID excuse me Order ID will be a request and then it's

48
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:49,780
encoded in the u r n l so it's parents and then order ID that is what I specified here in my routes

49
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,840
file order ID that's the name and therefore I have to retrieve it by that name in my controller.

50
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
So Order ID here.

51
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:07,690
Now have an order Id file name or d d NYS name will be looking for will be in my stash and then my order

52
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,630
ID and then thought PTF right.

53
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,560
That is the format in which all our invoices are stored let's say.

54
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:21,280
So now we need to retrieve that file and we can retrieve falls within those file system.

55
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,560
We use that before in the course already.

56
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,220
So let's start using it again.

57
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:32,920
Let's import it fault system by requiring fault system this is a core not an old module if you remember

58
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:38,590
you don't need to install a package it's already included in node and the file system allows to do things

59
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,630
like read files which sounds like a thing that makes sense here.

60
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,830
So let's use the file system and read a file.

61
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,570
We know it will be found in the data folder.

62
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:57,040
Now the payoff your should be constructed with the Poth core module so that it works on all operating

63
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,090
systems.

64
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:06,610
So let's also import path by requiring lbf and number of core node module the module and let's construct

65
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:16,620
that path to the invoice so I'll have my anywise Poth and all treated with lbf join and I'll be looking

66
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,940
for the data folder that the.

67
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,030
That's the first element.

68
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:26,730
Then in Wise's folder and then the invoice name the file name.

69
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,650
So this is the POF which I want to read.

70
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:35,980
So I'll pass that invoice path to read file read file then gives me a callback.

71
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:42,580
So a function which it will execute once it's done reading that file.

72
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:51,350
So here I will even get an error or the data data will be in the form of a buffer.

73
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,000
Now of course we should check if we have an error.

74
00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:00,150
And if that is the case well then we simply next to it so that the default error handling function can

75
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,030
take over Otherwise if we don't have an error.

76
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,280
Here old returned by the way so that the error code won't execute.

77
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:13,110
So if we don't have an error then data should be my my file right.

78
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,130
So then I can call wrests send.

79
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,810
Which is a function provided by the Express Middler my data.

80
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,460
Now theoretically that should be the file.

81
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,760
Now let's see if that works.

82
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,950
And to make it work we have to use this route in our anchor task.

83
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:41,810
So in orders each as and this anchor tag we'll be looking for Slash orders slash.

84
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,640
And now we need to output something dynamic with each base and that is the order ID because that's what

85
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,860
we're looking for in the route.

86
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:55,430
So the order ID is simply order underscore ID which we use up there already.

87
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,300
So lets output that here.

88
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:03,100
Let's say that and reload that page and now look.

89
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,640
That's lictors in wise here.

90
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:11,880
And I do get my download option here let me save that and try to open that file.

91
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:18,100
And indeed it should open as a PDA where you should be able to open it as a PTF But of course it was

92
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,060
not the most convenient way of downloading this.

93
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,460
We had a strange name right.

94
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,610
This strange cryptic name we don't have TPD ethics tension and all of that.

95
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,740
So we can certainly improve that.

96
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,610
Let's do that in the next lecture.
