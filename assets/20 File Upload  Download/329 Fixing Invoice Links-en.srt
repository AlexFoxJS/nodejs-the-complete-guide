1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:11,160
Now one last adjustment I want to make is that I want to go into my views real quick and fix the placement

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,570
of my IT link in the orders.

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:19,360
E.J. last fall there I have that in ways link next to every product that is incorrect of course.

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,010
It should be next to the order.

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:28,050
So next to the Order ID I will have my NYC link so that now if I reload that orders page I have that

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,760
link up there which makes more sense logically but the behavior of course didn't change.
