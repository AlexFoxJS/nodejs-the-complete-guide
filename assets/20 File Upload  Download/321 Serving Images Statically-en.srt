1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:09,940
So how can we ensure that all our beautiful images are also served to the client that they are downloaded.

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:15,650
We've got multiple options for serving files and I will walk you through all of them now.

3
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,840
Option number one which you would typically use for a scenario like this where you have files that are

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,670
publicly available to everyone.

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:29,220
Like our product images is that we simply serve our images folder in a static way.

6
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,530
What does this mean.

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:37,850
This means you go to app chase and there we already are static serving a folder we are serving the public

8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,820
folder with the express static middleware.

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,550
Now we can serve more than one folder statically and remember statically serving a folder simply means

10
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:52,500
that requests to files in that folder will be handled automatically and the files will be returned.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,850
So all the heavy lifting is done behind the scenes by express then I can duplicate this middleware and

12
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,630
now also serve the images folder just like this.

13
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,360
And with this little change if I save that and the server and therefore restarts if we reload this page

14
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,680
we still fail.

15
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,280
Well if we inspect that failing request we see that it tried to get the image from admen slash images.

16
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,570
The reason for that is that I'm on the admin route here.

17
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,480
Admin products to be precise.

18
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:29,070
So it's only replacing the last part of my path with that image.

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,780
Eurail the solution for that is pretty straightforward.

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:42,460
In our view products Aegis where a do show my image we suddenly need to add a slash at the beginning

21
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,610
which will turn this into an absolute Poth.

22
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:51,280
So it will not appended to the current pov but driver create a new POV with only our domain and then

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,770
the POV which gets rendered here and I DUDAS and products.

24
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,400
And of course also on my shop page.

25
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,970
So on index Ejaz.

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,180
So basically everywhere where I do render an image I add a slash at the beginning.

27
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:09,430
The alternative would be to store that lbf in a database with a slash at the beginning of course might

28
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,150
have been easier.

29
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,050
But I want to show you both ways.

30
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:17,080
So here I'll added in my views also here in the product list Ejaz fall

31
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,280
like this and all the product detail follow of course.

32
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,050
There we all have an image.

33
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:34,340
If we change all of that and I now reload this page I still fail and not a reason for that is something

34
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,440
different.

35
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:41,690
The reason for that is that the POF now is correct but my image is here in the images folder are served

36
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,720
incorrectly in Aperture diasporas set up this static Miller.

37
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:53,520
Keep in mind what I taught you earlier in this course we basically point to a folder there like public

38
00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:01,100
images and we then tell express surfed of files from inside that folder as if they were on the root

39
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,310
folder.

40
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,050
So we would see that image if we go there and we see the POF under which it try to find it.

41
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:15,050
If we open that in and you tap we can find it of course but we will see it if I remove images there.

42
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:21,110
And the reason for that is that express assumes that the files in the images folder are served as if

43
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,570
they were in the root folder.

44
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,060
So slash nothing.

45
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,240
Of course we want to keep them in the images folder and keep the POF like this.

46
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,220
And for this we can simply adjust our middleware here and say if we have a request that goes to slash

47
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:43,310
images that starts with Slash images then serve these files statically and now slash images into a folder

48
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,010
we assume for this static serving.

49
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,380
And now with that if we save that and we reload we see our image here.

50
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:56,870
So now we got that working and now we got a static way of serving our files and that is a great way

51
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,660
off serving the.

52
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,340
Now I want to do something different though.

53
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:09,230
I want to add this to the cart ordered it so that I have an order and I want to download an invoice

54
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:15,590
for that order and that will now work differently because invoices will not be public fault's that everyone

55
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,970
should be able to access.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,050
I want to be able to access my wise.

57
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,580
But no one else should be.

58
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,940
So let's focus on this in the next lectures.
