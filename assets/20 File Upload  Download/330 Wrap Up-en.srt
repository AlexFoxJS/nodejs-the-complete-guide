1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,920
That's it for this module you'll learn a lot about files.

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:12,280
You'll learn how to add file upload functionality both in the form and then most importantly on the

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:19,480
back end by using Mulder this nice middleware which automatically extracts files from incoming requests

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:26,300
and store them as specified by us and which also is able to filter out certain file types if we want

5
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:26,960
you.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,230
You learned how to store files both for adding and editing items.

7
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:39,490
So how to manage debt and you of course also learn how to download files how to surf them statically

8
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:45,040
with the help of that static milah were expressed as ships with and how to make sure that this uses

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,430
the right path.

10
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:53,620
And alternatively or depending on your requirements how you can surf false as a response in a route

11
00:00:53,950 --> 00:01:01,090
like with get order here in the shop J.S. controller where we saw multiple different options of serving

12
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,140
a file that already existed for example by loading it into memory and then returning it.

13
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,760
Or that you could scream such a file instead.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,570
Or you can even generate Follett's on the fly if required depending on what your application requirements

15
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:23,230
are and then you learn a lot of things about how to work with files with streams with responses and

16
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:28,890
this hopefully helps you implement fall related features into your next application.
