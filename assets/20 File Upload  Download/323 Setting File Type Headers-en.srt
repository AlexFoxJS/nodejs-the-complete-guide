1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:09,140
We have our code for downloading a file and this file is now only available if we are locked in.

2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:15,400
Now we can improve the way we return this however we can pass some extra information to the browser

3
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:22,150
so that it uses a different file name and also with the right extension for this we'll set some headers

4
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,460
so we can use set header for it.

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,500
And first of all we can set the content type to application slash PTF because that is what it is here

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,660
where it's like this.

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,910
Let's see what this does.

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,480
If I save it like that and I now click this button now I open it in the browser.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,450
So this already changes to behavior.

10
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,450
It already gives the browser some information which allows the browser to handle isn't a better way.

11
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,110
And for most browsers simply open them in line.

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,620
So in the browser so that's great but we can't pass more information.

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:05,080
We can also set a number header and that is the contents Dasch disposition.

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,800
This allows us to define how this content should be served to the client.

15
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:18,620
We can set this to inline to still tell the browser to open it in line for example if I'd change it

16
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:28,220
like this nothing changes but we can also for example add a file name here so we can add semi-colon

17
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:36,020
and then file name and set this equal to in double quotation marks to follow them you want to serve.

18
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,930
So in my case it would be in wife's name right.

19
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:47,470
So we can also said follow them equal to double quotation marks plus in wife's name plus closing double

20
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:56,580
quotation mark contained between single quotation marks final saved is and I click this button.

21
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,130
Now we don't see a difference with the name when opening it in line because it's open and liberals are

22
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,730
anyways.

23
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,720
But we can change in line to attachment for example.

24
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,720
Now if Dad adjusted if the key going in was the download menu opens again.

25
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,510
And now here we have the proper file name with the proper extension.

26
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,790
And this is how you can control how the browser should handle the incoming data.

27
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,950
Should it automatically open it should it instead let you download it.

28
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,220
So I'll switch this back to inline.

29
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,620
But keep the following here.

30
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,580
And now I have a set up where only offene could add users can request this in ways we can still improve

31
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:32,850
that.
