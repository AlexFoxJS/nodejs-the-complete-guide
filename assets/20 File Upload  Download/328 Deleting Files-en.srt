1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,920
Now in this module we covered a lot.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,510
And we work with files a lot.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:11,870
Now one thing you might notice is that whenever we for example change an image or when we delete a product

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:17,360
to a file belonging to that product the image belong to the product sticks around.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,790
Now obviously you can always delete files with the file system package.

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,700
There you also got options for deleting foz.

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:33,470
You could delete false whenever you added a product when you override the image.

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,630
So here if you are inside that if block and we set a new image you are l.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,340
Then we could all the kick of a function that goes ahead and deletes the old image by fetching dead

10
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,050
from the product first because we're fetching the product here so we can get access to the old image

11
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:54,020
lbf by fetching that POV and then using the file system to delete that old image and we can of course

12
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,590
also lead to image when we delete the product.

13
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:06,350
So let's add this functionality as a last step now and for that I will go to my utile folder

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,180
and add a file Jaspal where I will add some help or functionality.

15
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:23,090
They are all import to follow system so the fault system is imported here and I'll have a constant which

16
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:32,270
holds a function which I'll name delete file disfunctions should accept the file path and debts.

17
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:39,320
Let's see in here I can use the filesystem package and there.

18
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,690
You'll have to try and link Methot it deletes the name and default it is connected to the names or deletes

19
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,060
a file it does Poth.

20
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:56,640
So here I pass fall POF and then this has to call because we know with an error if it fails and in here

21
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,860
we can simply check if we got an error.

22
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,920
Then I want to throw it again and then it should bubble up in our default express air handler should

23
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,090
be able to take over.

24
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,200
Otherwise I'll not do anything here.

25
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,680
So it's like method.

26
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,660
I can always call to pass and fall apart and delete that file.

27
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,820
And now we can use that in our admin controller.

28
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:30,860
So let me import my file helper here or requiring it from the utl folder and the ERDA file file and

29
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,410
I can use that file helper.

30
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:40,780
For example in the place where we added a product if we are and is if block and we know will replace

31
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,960
the image you are l.

32
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:50,650
Then before I do so I will use Fall helper and call my function there for dead.

33
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,170
I need to export that though.

34
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,530
So in here I want to export delete file.

35
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,000
This will hold my delete Falah constant.

36
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,680
So does function and now in the Edmond J as controller.

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,360
Here I can call fall helper delete file and pass in product image.

38
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:16,590
You are also the path to dat file and now does chaud fire.

39
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,770
I'm not waiting for this to complete.

40
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,030
I continue with my eyebrow operations.

41
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,150
I'm doing this in a fire and forget manners.

42
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,210
I'm firing this function and I don't care about the result.

43
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:32,910
If I wanted to I would have to pass my callback here so a function which then continues with the rest.

44
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,070
In this function here.

45
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,140
But I simply fire it like this and I will do the same when we delete a product.

46
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:51,080
So in there when we do delete it here I also want to delete the respective image.

47
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:57,000
And for that I first of all need to fetch by product of course so I will have find my ID in here.

48
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,710
Find it by Prod. ID.

49
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:09,160
And then here I have then and catch and catch I can next any error I get and then block I will have

50
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,550
access to my product.

51
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,000
So here I can then ex you by fall helper.

52
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:23,030
I should of course all the check if product is not set in which case I'll also return next with a new

53
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,400
error product not found.

54
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:34,790
And otherwise I delete that and it should only trigger delete one here after I found this.

55
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,370
Otherwise we have a race condition where deleting could finish before finding is finished and that would

56
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:47,980
be bad so we'll grab that delete one code move that here and return it to return to Brahmas return by

57
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,720
delete one.

58
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,270
And then I can actually replace that catch block with my old then and catch block and does will catch

59
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:03,020
arrows in any of the then blocks and it will also make sure that at first find the product once I have

60
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,000
found it.

61
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,150
I delete the image and I assembles heinously start deleting the product itself.

62
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,130
Let's save all dead and let's see if that works.

63
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:24,620
If I go back to Aben products here and I delete product one this is cleared and here I also have one

64
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:31,530
much less if I delete the second product it's only free images so this works.

65
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,650
Diablerie images are still sticking around because previously when I started deleting products and so

66
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,520
on I did not have that logic in place but now this works.

67
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,100
Fetching my wise or generating it on the fly were.

68
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,480
And thanks to the fact that we store a snapshot of that in the database.

69
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,670
It even works after the product was deleted.

70
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,700
Which is of course the way we want it to work.

71
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,810
With that we have a really nice setup here.
