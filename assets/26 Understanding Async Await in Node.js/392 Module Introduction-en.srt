1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:09,750
You'll learn about a brand new type of back in the application you can build with no as a restful API

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,770
and you'll learn that it's not that far off from the server side rendered no application we built before.

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,600
The only major difference is how you handle requests and response data.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,940
You send Jason data now with that out of the way.

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:30,870

00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,390
to restfully your eyes.

7
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:39,960
I want to dive into the async a wait keywords which is relatively new javascript language feature which

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,240
you can use again in any place in your node.

9
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:50,700
J.S. code this does not have to be used in a restful API you can or can not use it anywhere.

10
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,140
Now I will explain what's up with these two key words how you used them and why you would use them.
