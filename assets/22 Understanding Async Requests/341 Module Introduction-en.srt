00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,560
Thus far in this course we always had a look at a particular kind of request and response.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,900
The request was always a request sent from our browser.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:18,360
When we submitted a form or entered a u r l or clicked a link and the response always was either a redirect

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,910
or a new home page.

5
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:27,810
Now that can take you very far but sometimes you get some work some requests that will only happen behind

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,680
the scenes.

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,770
That means you don't want to get back and you h team l page you only want to exchange some data with

8
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,110
the server for example and it will show you what I mean and how this works in this module.

9
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,170
So we'll have a look at what Asynchronous JavaScript requests are why we would use them and how we will

10
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:46,640
use them.
